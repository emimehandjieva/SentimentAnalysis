I needed a pair of bluetooth headphones for running, and since the S10 was specifically designed to be water resistant, I tried to convince myself the naysayers were just not using the headphones correctly.  Well, I was wrong.  The S10 headphones are every bit as uncomfortable as people have said:  specifically, they squeeze a small spot directly above your ear.  I cannot see myself using them for longer than 10 minutes without discomfort.  Also, I was a bit disappointed by the sound quality when I first tried them on, but didn't know how bad it was until I tried on the S9 headphones.The S9 is lighter, more comfortable, and sounds much nicer in terms of audio quality than the S10.  The material that contacts the skin has a more padded texture, and the headphone itself is less rigid so they don't grip as tightly as the S10.  This is not a bad thing, as the lightness of the S9 still allows it to be worn securely in place.  The most noticeable difference was the fidelity.  The S9 has much nicer bass response, but don't let that distract you from the whole soundscape.  The S9 performs better across all frequencys, and really separates the instruments and vocals.  The soundstage is very nice with the S9s.Overall, the only \"benefit\" of the S10 is that it is designed more for exercising, and is supposed to be more water resistant.  I wasn't able to test this, but there are plenty of reviewers that say their S10s shorted out due to sweat/moisture.  That said, I'll stick with the S9s.  I'm only marking down one star because the design doesn't allow them to be easily worn with most eye glasses... but this is a minor complaint.UPDATE: I've been comparing the two sets again... and found some drawbacks to the S9-HD, surprise surprise.  Battery life: S10-HD is better.  Reception: S10-HD is better.  Why can't Motorola design a headset with the comfort and fidelity of the S9-HD, and the ruggedness, battery life, and Bluetooth reception of the S10-HD??

I would do business with this company again.  These are the best active headsets for the price.  I've had several of these headsets as well as others and I found that this is the best pair out on the market.  There is a newer model (S-10) but the reviews on it was not very positive.  The reviewers recommended sticking to this model because S-10's do not have the same sound quality as these.  My only complaint is that they are not fully sweat proof.  The reason I've had several over the years is because moisture and water tend to get in the ear buds and controls causing the headsets to malfunction.  On the other hand, I've bought other brands and they do not even come close to the kind of quality as these models.  I've had one pair last as long as a year and some last 3-6 months.  I'm an avid trainer so I sweat a lot.  I think it's a good trade off considering the other options.  I do wish Motorola does resolve this issue with future models though.Oh, and don't fall for the imitations that come from China.  I had three of them and always returned or asked for my money back.  They are cheaper but the quality is just ridiculously poor.  To combat this, I always check to see if the product is being delivered from China.  Also make sure that the product description says brand new and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).  You can also insure the headset with SquareTrade Warranties for like $7.

I charge overnight and it lasts all day (I have a 3+ hour commute, twice a day)- Remote buttons on headset work great with iPhone 4 (all buttons functional)- Works perfectly with PS3- Nice feature to turn off blue, glowing button, so you're not alerting the world that you're wearing expensive headphones- No chords to get tangled, when you take them out of your bag - nothing dangling around as you run/walkCONS:- Sort of uncomfortable in the winter, if you are all bundled up--back 'bar' gets in the way of your jacket or scarf, but I imagine these will ROCK in the Summertime.  Lying down with these is unfortunately not an option, either, but expected for 'behind-the-ear' headphones- Signal can drop outside, in open spaces--placement is key (not in front pocket, but in side bag, backpack or on arm, using arm band). In NYC, I only noticed it when crossing streets.  This is due to how a bluetooth signal is broadcast.  Putting my iPhone in my messenger bag, however, completely solved the problem and I experience no skips at all in sound.- Phone calls work great and I can hear person on the other end just fine, BUT some have mentioned they can't hear me very well.  UPDATE 5/22/2011:  Not great in a Jeep (of course--nothing is:), but I've called others who said they could not tell I was on a headset.  Granted, I was in my home, but it was really nice just walking around the house, on a call, as my iPhone 4 remained on the counter.  So, not really a CON--these are designed for music first, phone calls second--keep that in mind. If you want both, these are still the best solution I've found and they are a good solution, at that.  Not perfect, but very good.  In a 'normal' car, I think they would sound fine, but may not be practical when driving...(watch out for cops--shouldn't be wearing headphones while driving:)...UPDATE/FYI 5/22/2011:  Headphones stopped charging for a couple of days--plugged it in and no light would come on and it was not charged after being plugged in all night.  Tried plugging it into a pc and got the same--no charging light (briefly flashes, then goes off).  Then, I tried it again (15 minutes later) with the PC and it started charging...so, I tried using the AC plug again and it's now charging normally/light is on, etc.  Not sure WHAT that was...I still love these headphones and I used them constantly.  Hoping that continues. It could be something with the AC charger...SUMMARYOverall, I can still HIGHLY recommend these, after using them extensively for the past 5 months--haven't tested in the heat or when working out heavily (heard it has issues with sweat...), but for my purposes--a 3 hour daily train commute, walking in NYC and working around the house, they work fantastic.  The sound is amazing and the fit is almost perfect.  Using the large ear buds (comes with 3 sizes) seems to also help drown out misc. external noise, which is nice.

Charme", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I am a runner and have been using these headphones for the past four years with different devices on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors. Currently I use them with my iPhone 4S, with which this headset paired effortlessly. However I am now on my third headset.After about a year the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement headset. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.Soon after getting that replacement I started going to a gym where the treadmill area was not well ventilated and tended to be humid. I got drenched in sweat and so did the headset. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the ear buds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be \"zapped\" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that this headset is not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my first gym. I have since switched gyms, and my new gym is well ventilated. I also wear the Buff (which I have reviewed on Amazon) when I run. Since this covers my entire head and is great for absorbing sweat, including sweat on the back of my neck,  the sweat is no longer an issue for me.Note: If you want a corded headset to use when sweat will be an issue, I suggest the Sennheiser PMX 70, which I have reviewed on Amazon.In any event, my latest headset has been working just fine for the past three years.Before purchasing this headset, you should keep some things in mind.First, depending on what device you use, it may be necessary to buy a separate blue tooth adapter (I had to do that when I used this headset with an iPod).Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headset on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headset did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headset on first.Third, since the headset is curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headset, which will come slightly out of its position in your ears. So wearing the headset with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headset as the collar pushes against it. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use this headset comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane). Likewise you will need to remove it to use certain equipment at the gym, like the situp bench.All in all I am very satisfied with this product now that I have resolved the sweat issue.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear.

Contrary to other reviewers, I have a pretty comfortable fit. Pairing is also very easy.

When battery starts to drain over time (say an hour or so) the cut-offs become more often. Either the battery is too small or not fully charging fully (or both). Perhaps, with a few more charge/discharge cycles the situation may improve. I'll update this review if I see an improvement.Edit2: The cut-offs are continuing after over a month use.

Recently, his Verizon contract came up for renewal, whereby he was eligible for a new phone at a discounted price (with a 2-year contract of course), but he refused to give up his Dare, in spite of its being all beat up (he had chosen to not use screen or phone covers while he had it). He was adamant about keeping his Dare, saying it did all he wanted it to do, it was the right size and feel, etc., etc. He also did not want to spend the extra money on a data plan he wasn't going to use (we both have plenty of computer access otherwise) so a smartphone was out.  Since I'm the \"geeky\" one in this family I did the research on feature (aka \"dumb\") phones he might like, and unfortunately the pickings were quite slim...it's obvious that the phone companies, or at least Verizon, are moving towards having very few feature phones, if any.  Desperate, I came to amazon--which is where I come first whenever I want to buy something. Not expecting to find it, I looked for and found the Dare through this seller.  The phone appeared to be brand new and we immediately had it activated at Verizon without any problems.  Plus: my husband is not locked into a 2-year plan! This time my husband agreed to a case and screen cover which I also bought through amazon.  My husband is very happy with this purchase,and I hope it will last him at least a couple more years. I should mention that the phone IS internet capable if that's something you do want. The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is because the cover on the SD slot of the phone was loose.  My husband played around with it finally getting it to fit it, but we're not sure what will happen when he needs to open it again, if it will open or if it is stuck, etc.  This won't be a major problem since more than likely he won't be using the sd card on the phone for his pictures.  I complained to the seller about this and received a response within 24 hours.  By then the problem had been solved by my husband, but I appreciated the seller's willingness to help and satisfy me, the customer. So, the problem is not with the seller, but with a small defect of the phone itself.  I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller, and who knows, maybe in a few years my husband will want yet another Dare!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My husband is very happy!", "unixReviewTime": 1328400000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2012"}

One other thing, LG USA does not have any information nor will they help with the phone even though it bears their name. I could not get help to access the USB driver from them.

However, it does have a few problems/limitations:Touchscreen: This phone uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive touchscreen. The touchscreen isn't very responsive at times, which is a real annoyance. (Capacitive touchscreens, such as those on the iPhone and Blackberry Storm, are more responsive and support multi-touch gestures.)Homescreen: You can only add/remove a predefined set of widgets on the Homescreen: Calendar, Clock/Alarm, Notes, Music Player, Picture Viewer, Social Networking (My Space, Twitter, Facebook), and International Time.Single-Axis Accelerometer: The keyboard doesn't always change to a full QWERTY keyboard when you change the orientation of the phone from vertical to horizontal.Web Browser: Browsing the Web using the built-in Web Browser is a frustrating experience. The links on a page don't load at least half the time when you click on them. The page also takes a while to refresh after it's been scrolled. I downloaded and installed Opera Mini, which works flawlessly.Email: The phone can store only 300 email messages. Once the capacity is reached, you have to delete existing emails from the Inbox in order to retrieve more emails. Deleting emails is a hassle: you have to (1) select and delete emails from the Inbox (deleted emails are then placed in the Deleted folder) and (2) navigate to the Deleted folder and delete the emails again before they are finally expunged.Syncing With Outlook: I am able to sync with Outlook on my PC only through USB, not bluetooth. I get a \"Pairing setting is failed while connecting with the device [sic]\" error message with bluetooth syncing. The To Do list is barely functional -- there is no way to sort it and the subject field is only about 14 characters wide. Calendar and To Do List are limited to 500 items.FM Radio: The FM Radio only works with the earbuds (included) plugged in. The earbuds use a proprietary LG connector, not a standard 3.5mm audio plug. The sound from the earbuds is tinny.Camera & Video: The camera has no autofocus, much less zoom capability. The camera is best used for close-up shots (distant objects are blurry). The video is very choppy because of the low frame rate (12 fps).---There you have it.

So, when I took a trip to Germany and found the LG KP500 there, I was quite curious. I looked up reviews here on Amazon, and after some consideration, bought the phone from a German electronics retailer... And I am sure glad that I did!Let's get started with the Pros and the Cons of this phone.PROS:-Unlocked, Quadband World Phone.-Inexpensive. I bought the phone for 89, which is comparable to the price here on Amazon.-Good Quality. Although the phone is small and made of plastic, it has an extremely durable feel.-Signal Quality. I normally have no signal with T-Mobile's To-Go plan in my house, but I usually have at least 3 bars with this phone. By comparison, my last three phones constantly lost signal in my house.-Great features. Many features, including a Movie editor, 3MP Camera, Music Player, Video Recorder, Games, Accelerometer, and drawing pad.-Stylus. Not really necessary, but it really helps with texting and making notes.-Multiple Apps and Task Manager. You can run more than one app at a time, like Music Player and Camera-Widgets. On the home page, there is a selection of widgets to choose from. These include: Music Player, World Clock, Clock, Calender, FM Radio, and Notepad.-Speed Dial Widgets. With a swipe of the finger, the home page changes to a speed dial home page with up to 10 contacts and images.-Downloadable Apps and Games. The phone is Java based, so you can download .JAR apps from a number of sites to transfer to the phone.-Expandable Memory via microSD slot (Up to 8gb)CONS:-The interface, while very sleek and refined, can become slow due to multiple apps running at once.-Texting in QWERTY format is a bet annoying at first, due to the small keyboard. But after a while, you get used to it.My recommendation: If you are looking for a new, unlocked phone at a cheap price, the LG KP500 is for you.NOTE: I own the silver version of this phone, which doesn't have the rubbery texture.UPDATE 10/2010-The phone is still working great. I actually received an update from T-Mobile to allow MMS messaging and internet web-browsing, so the phone is actually better now than it was 6 months ago!

I wasn't sure I'd even really like the BlackBerry, as it's a bar phone and I always chose flip models, but I love it.  Sure, the Javelin doesn't have 3G, but for most things, the EDGE network is perfectly fast and 3G isn't so much faster that I miss it for web browsing.Call Quality - in all honesty, I don't call much on the phone, but it gets plenty loud and I can usually hear calls just fine.  It doesn't drop calls unless my service sputters (ATT), but overall I have no complaints.Keypad - On this, I'm much pickier.  I love the QWERTY keyboard on this model.  My work phone is a BlackBerry World Edition 8830, whose keys are much more similar to the Bold and Tour.  I don't like those keypads as much.  There was, of course, a slight learning curve on the Javelin in typing time, but now typing is a breeze.  I type an awful lot on Gchat, via SMS, and via BlackBerry messenger, and I have no problem with the keys.  They're great, they're separated, and I don't often make a mistake on them.Trackball - I cannot praise this trackball enough.  RIM finally did away with the old recessed trackballs and created one that feels smooth and effortless.  I love it.Media player - I didn't actually expect to use this, but I lost my mp3 player.  I popped in an 8 gb microSDHC card (didn't have to remove the battery - nice feature), loaded up some music, and popped in earbuds.  Music doesn't sound so phenomenal that audiophiles would be happy with it, but to me it sounded perfectly acceptable.  Videos and pictures look spectacular on the display, and there's a playlist option for music.  All in all, pretty impressive for a phone meant for email.Display - Gorgeous.  Absolutely flawless.  Pictures look amazing, it's a pleasure to look at the screen.Connectivity - Again, no 3G on this device.  Unless you need to use data while talking on the phone, you won't miss it.Speaker - LOUD.  Not awesome sounding, but better than most mp3 players' built in speakers.Reasons why it gets 4 starts instead of 5 - MicroUSB, why?  Why remove the miniUSB that SO much of my other electronics have?  I hope I don't lose the charger . . . It can be a little laggy occasionally.  It's tough to find good accessories for this particular model.  It was $150 with a contract, why no accessories?  It should be much easier to find a good skin and screen protectors.All in all, the device is fantastic.  It's smaller than the Bold and the Tour, the screen is outrageously good, and it's a pleasure to type on.  I'd highly recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Little BlackBerry", "unixReviewTime": 1261526400, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2009"}

I have always been impressed by the devices they have created in the past and the current line of devices. Since I like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I just had to get a 8900.Most of you know by now what the new feature sets are of blackberries that are out today. The bold, the storm, and now this one The JAVELIN.I wont go into too much detail but I will give you my quick run down.The Javelin is perhaps the thinnest, lightest, small footprint blackberry that I have ever used. It sports a great look and the feel to the hands is awesome. It is after all the curve II. Screen comparison to the bold is that this unit has a higher resolution then the bold but a smaller physical screen. The higher resolution definitely adds some clarity to the screen...but it should be duly noted that the BOLD's screen is also beautiful. Yes I own both.The Javelin is a EDGE/Wi-FI device...it does not have 3G capabilities. Technically you only need 3G if you want to be on the phone and receive/send emails at the same time when using your mobile connections...I personally have never needed that functionality. However, please note that if you are connected to WI-FI you are able to be on a telephone call and receive/send email etc over wi-fi....works perfectly.The Javelin has a new processor which makes the device FLY. Yes the processor is slower then the one in the Bold, but one can hardly tell the difference....I have used both for weeks...and I can honestly say you will not notice the speed difference.I have a 8gb MicroSD card installed in the device and use the software available from blackberry to synchronize all of my DRM free music from iTunes to the Blackberry. A must buy if you want to carry one device that does it all. Amazon has great prices on micro-sd cards.....Here are what I consider to be the best features on the Javelin:1. AUTOFOCUS 3.2mp Camera - It is AWESOME. Picture taking, due to focus, is a bit slower....however, the clarity and quality of the picture make it all worthwhile.2. FOOTPRINT - Great looking device with a great size.3. High Resolution screen - Awesome clarity....4. The functionality of a blackberry has always been a pro..and this one makes it better with a faster processor and more zippy feel.The three BAD things:1. The speaker on this thing is so TINNY....that it hurts my ears with certain tones.....there is NO bass what so ever. That is to be expected in a device this small....so maybe some new tones need to be tested out.2. Micro-USB - Why take something like mini-usb and replace it with something new. Now I have to get all new chargers, travel chargers, etc.... Upsetting but bareable.3. The holster in the BOX is simply a pleather pouch of sorts...no belt clip etc... You will need to buy an aftermarket leather/plastic holster if you wish to attach to your belt. Not a deal breaker...but should be mentioned.I am posting some images for your review also.Overall this is a great 5 Star Device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The smallest, lightest, and best Blackberry around.", "unixReviewTime": 1234051200, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2009"}

So let me lay it all down here and save you a bit of trouble and touch on the important issues.COMFORT  - I hate hate hate HATE with a passion, earpieces that fit into the ear like ear buds or other bluetooth devices.  Sure, they look cool and I too, like to pretend I am Lieutenant Uhura answering a distress call from Regula Space Station but For the life of me, I cannot figure out how ANYONE thinks it is actually comfortable.  This is a headset.....sure, it is bulky in comparison but in my home office or a car without a bluetooth speaker, who the hell cares what it looks like.  The padding on the ear is very comfortable and the whole headset stays put and doesn't slide off.The only issue i had was a little soreness on the ear when I wear it too long AND I have glasses on.  But I don't wear it until I have a call now so that problem solved itself.RANGE - I haven't tested this out yet but i can move freely in my work area and not lose reception - I've never tested the 66' range but how often do you really go 66 feet away from your phone?SOUND QUALITY - on a scale from 1-10 I give this an 11.  I can hear the caller loud and clear and they can hear me just fine.  Most people do not even know I am on a bluetooth.  How bout that!!!!NOISE CANCELLATION -  YES, this actually works.  I have no idea how this technology works to cancel out the wind and other crap but picks up &#34;important&#34; sounds other than my voice - could it be magic?  Could it be voodou? (no I spelled it correctly, voodoo is incorrect) could it be the work of space aliens?  Could be be who cares because it works and works well.BATTERY LIFE -  this last a LONG fricken time between charges - even when i forget to turn it off when I leave the house without it.  I think I charge 2 times a week with moderate use.  BUT when the battery dies, it doesn't hang up on your caller.  Nice!CUSTOMER SUPPORT - This is one of those companies that runs their business as it should.  First I'll say that this is NOT my first headset.  The first headset I got from them started malfunctioning so i called in and they said to just send it back.  They'd repair it or replace it if repairs were impossible.  I think they told me half the truth and just sent out a new one since I had a headset back in my possession rather quickly but the bottom line is that i was not out my headset for very long.  THAT headset lasted two years...maybe longer - I think.....hell, I dunno....it was a long time ago.Anyway, that first one died when I went into battle with a spider in my kitchen and in my panic the headset was flung into a sink with a used stockpot full of soapy water.  I immediately plunged the headset into a bowl of rubbing alcohol (yes, I keep copious amounts of this stuff on hand for cleaning since it works better on glass AND is a lot cheaper AND it USUALLY works on electronics that have gotten wet...but really, I shouldn't have to justify that purchase to you)  I'd be willing to bet it may have worked if it had just been water but i think there was red sauce in there too and most electronics won't function well on marinara with garlic and artichoke hearts.ADJUSTABLE - It fits my medium head as well as my husband's 'larger&#34; head (if i said BIG head here he'd take it the wrong way....he has a healthy ego and is NOT overbearing in anyway.  He is also a great cook, has an Emmy and NO, you don't have a shot at him so look but don't touch) and it also adjusts to fit my 8 year old in the rare event i can get her on the phone to talk to her grandparents....I am counting my blessings though that she is not fused to a phone yet.....so not looking forward to the teen years.DURABILITY - It takes a fair amount of abuse - afterall, it was designed for truckers so you can take it off and toss it down onto the table and take off down the street to catch up with the ice cream truck when needed.  Word of warning, it will NOT function with spaghetti sauce in the earpiece.  Do not submerge this in soup, drawn butter, marinara, reduction, chowder or any other liquid.  Do not use this in the shower.COMPATIBILITY - I have used this with an iPhone (3, 3S & 5), a Sony Ericsson Experia, Samsung Infuse and Samsung Galaxy Note.  All worked perfectly with this headsetCONS - You WILL indeed look like a Wendy's drive thru operator or Judy from Time Life Books when wearing this.  Expect silly comments from warped spouses or co-workers.BOTTOM LINE.....if you do not want to violate your ear canal or have something looped over the top of your ear feeling like it is going to fall off, get this headset.

{"reviewerID": "A2MSSJOJ24V7XR", "asin": "B001PBWNOY", "reviewerName": "Kimberly Lazarski \"Kimberly\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I have owned this headset for six months now, so this review is based on long-term, near daily use.I previously owned a BlueAnt - it's small and cute but the sound quality was dismal at best. I drive sporty cars so it made it difficult for others to hear me while I was driving. I had disassembled it and found that the pickup tube for the mic was kinked and didn't even face the microphone cutout so I fixed that (and disassembled a second BlueAnt I had purchased - same problem, so it's a design issue, not damage nor a fluke), and it did improve the sound quality on the other end, but not enough. I asked a trucker friend what truckers use for headsets and he recommended the BlueParrot B250-XT. I put off purchase for many months because quite honestly it does look dorky, so I looked at alternatives - Motorolas with the &#34;flip the mic to answer&#34; (the flip-mic-to-answer looks frail, and the reviews confirmed it as a failure point), Jawbones, which are supposedly renown but have had reliability problems, so I decided to put off the purchase.Then I decided to move on from my company and sound quality became much more important as I often take calls from hiring managers while driving and the BlueAnt wasn't cutting it. So, I decided to go ahead with the BlueParrot. When I received it and started using it, I was immediately impressed. For a worst-case test while driving on the highway I called my parents who are hard of hearing. They could clearly understand me while I was in my car with the moonroof open. Perfect! So far the other end has not had sound quality issues, and noise cancellation is obviously working, so the biggest problem (lousy mic + lots of background noise compounding the problem) was solved.On the receiving (my) end sound quality is equally good, as is volume (you can turn the volume up enough to overcome wind noise of open windows on the highway!).Design: it is comfortable to wear (albeit dorky looking), and stays in place, with no having to fiddle with aligning an easy-to-lose silicone cone with your ear canal.Pros:* Fantastic sound quality - on the transmission end, the mic has both great selection and noise cancellation, and the receiving end (the ear speaker) has great fidelity and volume.* Long battery life - and the battery pack is user-replaceable* It is far more comfortable than over-the-ear or in-ear headsets* You can switch sides by merely flipping the microphone boon around 180. I always use it on the right ear because the right ear is nearly always better for language recognition (applying science here) which reduces distraction when talking while doing other things (e.g., driving). Using the left ear requires more concentration (again, based on science not conjecture/opinion) which may result in distracted driving (opinion based on extrapolating the science to its obvious conclusion). Southpaws (lefties) might find the opposite to be true.* You can disable the flashing light, and you can also pair this headset with multiple devices. I don't use either feature but they are good to have.* It comes with an alternate open-cell foam replacement air pad and a replacement foam windscreen for the mic* Replacement battery packs, microphone wind noise screens, and ear cups/pads are readily available on amazon ( I ordered a set when I ordered the headset), and according to my trucker friend who recommended this model, at truck stops (I have not verified the latter).Cons:* As I implied it is utilitarian: form follows function and certainly isn't a fashion statement. More than once at drive throughs I have gotten funny looks and when I asked &#34;do I have something on my face? You're looking at me funny&#34; clerks have told me &#34;Oh, I thought that was one of our headsets.&#34; So it is indeed &#34;dorky&#34; looking.  I've bought more &#34;stylish&#34; bluetooth ear pieces but the sound quality suffered so much that I decided that I don't care. I want a headset that WORKS.* It charges via a barrel connector at 9 VDC rather than 5VDC over Micro-USB or Mini-USB. This means if you go on a trip and forget your charger, you will be unable to charge it on the go, and will be unlikely to find an AC or DC adapter to fit. The design really should have used Mini- or Micro-USB which is pretty standard for phones (except the iPhone). A USB-standard port would also allow for firmware updates to correct bugs (see below)* It requires two hands to put on - a potential hazard while driving. If I am expecting to receive or make calls I try to put it on when stopped, and just flip the mic up until it's needed.* The clip always gets tangled in my hair if I have my hair up or pulled back.  I wish the clip on the end of the head strap were round to prevent this. :-(* Sometimes it will drop the bluetooth connection, and rebooting it and rebooting the phone does not resolve the problem. Keeping it powered off for a period of time (5+ minutes) or plugging it into the charger for even 10 seconds then powering it back up corrects the problem. Other bluetooth headsets I had never had this problem - including the cheap-but-stylish BlueAnts.* I wish the buttons were better placed - I find myself disconnecting calls when reaching for the Volume-UP button.Despite the drawbacks above, I would purchase again but I would probably go for the B250-XT+ to improve upon the already-excellent noise cancellation and sound quality, but aside from the occasional bluetooth connectivity problem I have absolutely no regret going with the B250-XT.Deducting one star due to the occasional connectivity glitch.

This is it.There are several really good things about this headset.First is the long  \"talk\" time.  Most have just a few hours which works, unless you have long calls or listen to music or audiobooks or other things where you can go over the few hours.  This will work all day.  Everything else I want to keep going needs to be on the charger.  This has both a car and AC charger, but I can recharge overnight instead of right after a long call.Bluetooth range is great.  Most of the smaller headsets start dropping out if I'm across the room with it facing away from the paired device.  I tried it with Skype on my Mac and it works well there (as well as providing mono audio for other apps).The ear-speaker can be made loud enough to hear.  If you have someone at the other end that sounds like a whisper, you can turn it up where you can hear them.  This is the loudest headset I have found (insert hearing damage disclaimer).The noise cancellation is nearly perfect.  I have a Jawbone that works most of the time, but that little nub will come loose from my face enough to confuse it and the person at the other end starts asking me to repeat even in a silent room and there is no combination of ear inserts that are comfortable and secure that also consistently maintains contact with my face.  Here the mic is easily positioned at the corner of my mouth and if I blast my stereo you might hear a few quiet background whistles when I can barely hear myself! (none do percussion or transients well but my voice was crystal clear).It pairs with 3 devices - I wish it did more (I have too many gadgets), but this is more than most.  It can only work with one of the three at a time, so if I'm skype-ing, I can't use my phone.I find it reasonably comfortable, though it is larger/heavier - but the weight is distributed and it isn't tight.  It also seems to be solidly built.It might look unfashionable in comparison to some fancy in-ear headset, but you will be heard clearly even at a rock-concert, will be able to hear the caller, and be able to use it all day.One update/correction - it pairs with 8, yes EIGHT devices. my two phones, media computer, desktop, laptop, netbook and iPod touch (voice control) are all paired. The instructions say 3 in one place, 7 in another. If you pair a 9th, the oldest one is forgotten so you don't have to delete every one, but might have to redo the pairing on the original device. The only difficulty is that it will try to pair with whatever it can connect with so I often have to shut off one or more devices if they are all in the same room - a \"disconnect and try the next\" feature would help, but when I'm mobile I usually don't have this problem.. It works great with skype and google talk voice including making phone calls.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best bluetooth headset for long calls and most other uses", "unixReviewTime": 1297900800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2011"}

After using it for a few weeks now I feel I have to reevaluate and drop a star after encountering a growing problem with the trackball.I used the 8700g Blackberry for several years.  It was probably the last BB model that came with a trackwheel on the side instead of the trackball on the front.  Over the years the wheel never malfunctioned.  It was rock solid.  Of course, it was also very ineffective at moving around the screen.  RIM obviously had to come up with a better way.Like all mechanical mouses, the BB trackball will get dirt and dust underneath on the mechanical parts which causes problems with moving the cursor.  My google search indicated that this problem has popped up on probably every single BB made.After using the phone for a few weeks I have noticed that the downward motion is now much slower.  Left, right and up are OK for now, but those are also directions I use the least.  The downward motion is what a user would use to scroll quickly through an email or read a web site.  At this rate I'm going to assume that within 90 days I'm probably going to have to have the phone fixed or find out how to remove the outer casing to clean the trackball myself.  There are online instructions for other BB models, but I've yet to find anything about the 8900.  I'm going to be really annoyed if it's not possible on the user side to fix this problem.Now, on to the other pros and cons . . .ProsNew OS/interface is more stable and offers more featuresPhone is probably the smallest BB with a full keyboard.  A welcome change after using the 8700g, a model about twice the size in total volumeCamera has been upped to 3.2mp and comes with a flash.  Also has a video function, although I haven't tested that yet.Accepts Micro SD cards allowing you to have a full fledged MP3 player.  I put a class six 8gb card in mine for about $30ConsAs stated, the trackball!Back cover is a bit flimsyRIM doesn't provide enough themes with the OS and finding others (the much needed \"Today\" theme for example) is far more difficult than in the past.  You can get extra themes, but currently (as of early 2009), you will have to look hard for them as RIM isn't currently listing them on their online source page.Phone is actually slower at loading at some web sites than the 8700g on some networks.  The phone has a 2x faster processor.  T-Mobile needs to start thinking about moving on to 3G soon.RIM changed the power cord to micro USB.  The size difference is tiny, but it now forces users to buy new accessories (e.g. car chargers).  No excuse for this.The 8900 is a great phone to use.  It's an improvement over the earlier Curve and it's a few light years ahead of the old 8700g.  But the possible deal breaker for me is that trackball.  That the problem popped up so quickly and is such a common problem along the entire BB product line angers me more.  RIM should have come up with a solution for this by now.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "First impression 4 stars . . . after a few weeks the trackball has become an issue", "unixReviewTime": 1234742400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2009"}

While the 8900 is a nice upgrade for sure - RIM still suffers from build issues in the Curve model line. The battery door on mine (and I've read elsewhere that others have this too) is loose and has \"give\" to it when I type (yes, you can solve this by sticking a business card between the battery and door).I've been using the 8900 for a couple weeks now. I also have a BlackBerry Bold (which I prefer for the larger screen and different keypad which I find easier to use).If you have small hands - the 8900 is a nice phone. It's size will fit in your palm just right and not be difficult to hold.In practice I find the control keys (send, end, escape, menu) that are between the screen and the keyboard are difficult (perhaps uncomfortable is a better word) to press. If you don't press in the right spot - there's very little give and after a while continued use hurts your finger.The smaller keyboard on the 8900 is less comfortable for me. I'm using a BlackBerry Bold whose keyboard I prefer because the keys are less pointed on the Bold. This will be a matter of preference - so you should try the 8900 keyboard yourself prior to making a final decision.In testing the OS on the 8900 is fairly stable. I've owned T-Mobile UMA equipped BlackBerry's before and they all seem to have some tendency to sporadically lock up on incoming calls when on UMA (which is voice and data sent over Wi-Fi). The lock ups don't happen frequently (maybe once a week at most) - but they're annoying.RIM's latest OS (4.6) has a major lag time when re-booting. I haven't run a stopwatch against my devices but both the Bold and the 8900 easily run 5 minutes to reboot. Hopefully enough people will complain and RIM will fix this. Earlier models of the BlackBerry had this same reboot lag but I do not remember it being this lengthy.Overall here's my BlackBerry 8900 PRO / CON list:PROS:- Uses a much improved BlackBerry OS 4.6.x- Vastly improved camera of 3.2 mp- T-Mobile UMA allows calls via Wi-Fi when out of native T-Mobile coverage- T-Mobile UMA allows data, sms, mms via Wi-Fi- Re-designed form factor for those needing a smaller phoneCONS:- Battery cover has give when pressed during normal use- Lacks 3G capabilities- T-Mobile cellular coverage in Northeast (and I believe elsewhere) is the worst of all carriers- Sporadic lock ups while on UMA- Smaller screen and keyboard may be too small for some (especially screen)- Inserting micro-SD card requires removing battery cover (though not battery)Is this a good phone to buy?In a word - Yes. I think for the price Amazon offers it (after rebate) you have a hard time finding a better bargain. Given all the pros and cons I think you should zero in on the T-Mobile coverage first and be sure that you'll be adequately covered in your home usage area.Also, first time BlackBerry buyers should be aware that there's a mandatory BlackBerry data plan required to use this phone. I've read lots (LOTS) of messages on discussion boards about people trying to get around this and while it seems that some do skirt the data requirement (and be aware that if you buy through Amazon you are required to keep data on your line for a period of time or you can be assessed a penalty) - most find that there's no good way around a BB plan.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good improvement over prior Curve models", "unixReviewTime": 1235347200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2009"}

The weird thing is that if I plug my stereo standard 3.5 headphone into that same connection (using another 2.5 to 3.5 adapter) I do not get audio.After many frustrating hours I came up with one workaround that works - plug an earphone into the proprietary port and check for sound, then plug another one in the 2.5 and test and then plug -slowly- the 3.5 in - this gets me audio out and then I can unplug the other two.I just returned mine and ordered another from the same vendor.

It connects just to a few pins on one end. Weird.If you charge these at home, it's no issue but if you want to bring these on a trip with you, you have to pack this power supply. No USB charger, either -- it's wall current only. But the charge lasts a very long time so as long as you are not traveling, you don't need the charger.Sure wish they had use a micro USB charger connection.And yes, it does work with an iPhone 4.

This setup quite simply makes all other design efforts look bad. I don't mind the lack of controls-- I've always done everything through the phone anyway-- and my only real caveats are the annoying paper tag you're not supposed to remove and the short battery life. I recognize that the latter is probably unavoidable, but anything that could be done to improve battery life would be _most_ welcome. Also, it would be _very_ helpful if this device was USB-chargeable. I carry a large battery with a USB port on it to recharge my stuff, and have no access to an AC plug for most of the day. Active noise cancellation would be nice too, but is perhaps too much to wish for.I like using these earbuds so much with my iPhone 3gs that I plan to buy a second pair to give me enough battery life to last through a work shift, so that in essence I'll be paying over $200 for something that a single pair of, say, Motorolas might theoretically do for about a quarter of that price.

Adams \"Ms. Adams\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "These are probably one of the best bluetooth stereo headphones I've owned.  Sony is generally great when it comes to audio, and this headset is no different.  The design is amazing.  Very minimalist and sure to get you compliments and questions.  The power light is pretty discreet, which is also good since I hate loud blinking lights on my ears.  The cord is rather short, and if you have long hair and wear it down, it can get caught under the weight of your hair and tug.  The supplied earbuds ensure it stays put nice and snug and won't come out, even when jogging on open road.  The sound quality is also pretty good.  The bass isn't as strong as I'd like, but it does produce a nice overall and clear sound.  Coupled with the nose canceling earbuds and it makes for a good listening experience.  Call quality is also pretty good.  Volume is loud and clear and people I'm calling can't tell I'm using bluetooth.  Since there's only one button, it took me a bit to get used to the different functions it can be used for, and I'm sure there's still more I need to learn.  A long press powers it off and on, and the accompanying chime that goes with it are slightly different (lo-hi for ON and hi-lo for OFF).  Also, a shorter press of the button will activate the voice command feature (at least on a Motorola Droid Bionic) and it took me a while to get used to the different lengths I needed to hold the button in order to get the response I wanted.  The biggest drawback to this headset is the charger.  I'll admit that when I first received it and took all the components out of the box and saw the supplied charger, I had NO idea how I was supposed to get the headset on it.  I looked over the directions several times, and it shows in the diagram three different types of chargers you can use.  I'm assuming I didn't get what I was actually supposed to get in the box because the supposed included carrying case was not in there; instead, I got a little drawstring pouch.  Two of the three pictured chargers looked like something I could figure out, but the one that was included in my box was pretty hard to understand.  The charging contacts was at least twice the size of the earbud!!  How was I supposed to get that on??  I tried jamming it on one of the little plastic tabs on the charger, but I didn't want to push too hard because the charger looks very cheaply built and, quite honestly, antiquated.  It looks like a charger you'd see for a cell phone from the 90's.  The directions also don't really tell you how you're supposed to put them together.  I sat on my couch looking at it for a good 15 minutes before I just jammed them both together, after I stopped caring whether or not I broke it.  Surprisingly, that worked.  You have to push the earbud onto one of the tabs on the charger at a 90 degree angle pretty hard, but apparently, that's how it charges.  It'll suck when I need to travel with it / lose or break the charger / or just need another one, since it's such a weird little proprietary thing that looks like it stopped being manufactured at least 10 years ago.  If not for that god awful charger, this would be one of the best stereo bluetooth headsets available.  I still very much like it, but I can't give it a higher review because I foresee that charger becoming an issue down the road.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost Great", "unixReviewTime": 1318550400, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2011"}

Chang", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "While this headset is unique and quite sleek, I can't say too many positive things about this.  Here are the list of reasons why this headset is terrible:1) Fidelity - The sound quality was on par with a set of Coby earbuds, all mids and no highs or lows.  I had the earpiece properly inserted into my ear, sounds horrible.  Don't understand why some reviewers are saying the sounds are great, it truly lacks bandwidth and frequency response.2) Charging - Looks like the &#34;charger&#34; was an after thought or their attempt at recycling old stock.  You get this whacky, what I guess is a cell phone charger, but only a few pins on the charging are used, so only one &#34;latch&#34; out of two of the connector on the charger-side is used.  The charger looks Mickey-Moused.3) Lack of Volume and Next Track/Previous Track - Ok, no volume control I can deal with, no skip track or previous track?  That renders it unusable.  A while ago, I figured out that making playlists were really a waste of time, so I like to randomize my entire mp3 library on my iphone.  No next track/previous track means I have to whip out the phone.  The default corded iphone earbud with remote allows me to skip to next track, adjust volume without having to whip out my phone.  This feature is what garners this product a two-star.4) Wrong Material Choice?  The rubber on the ear bud fittings are of chalky, &#34;dry&#34; feeling rubber, as such, it will not grip the inside of your ear.  The slightest movement will make the ear bud fittings work itself out of your ear.  I miss my AcoustiBuds by Burton Technology.  They seemed to have gotten this part right, why can't a corporate giant like Sony/Ericsson get a simple material selection?  Did they not test it?  Did they test it on their own moist ear and said &#34;good enough&#34; and called it a day?  This is a piss poor selection of material, these in-ear buds have been around since they started handing out headsets on airplanes some 30 years ago.  With today's wider selection of all sorts of exotic rubbers, they couldn't get this little detail correct?5) The remote (if you can call it that) seriously is in a wrong place.  It's too high up.  I think this length was design for people with shorter necks.  It just wasn't well thought out.6)  Accessories that came with this earbud - the little clip that came with it is a joke, and removing the clip damaged the insulation on the wires.  The protective bag is just a cheap cloth bag you find in gimmicky audio accessories from generic manfacturers.What ever happened to Sony?  This brand has really gone down the drain.  Their TV sets suck, their audio accessories suck, their video game console sucks, everything from this company as of late really sucks.  This company is a joke.

There is now no reason to choose Sony. The Moto 'phones are equal or better in every aspect. In particular, the Moto 'phones stay on your head easily.These headphones offer good performance for the price. As other reviewers have noted, there are significant problems with this gadget. I suggest a work-around for some of these problems.Sound quality: not great. I have a pair of Sennheiser PMX60 mini-headphones that have better bass and a more \"detailed\" sound. But these little Sennheisers are about the same prices as the Sonys: http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PMX-60-PMX60-Headphones/dp/B00009LI55/ref=sr_1_45?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1264384037&sr;=1-45.Construction: these headphones are built light. They are suitable for doing chores around the house, brisk walks, and so forth. For use during all out exercise with sweat and motion, I'm just not sure.Fit: as other reviewers have noted, these 'phones fit the head very loosely. tilt your head forward, and they will slide right off. There is a related issue too. The drivers inside those big fat foam pads are tiny. You must position the drivers precisely over your ear canals, or the sound will be worse than \"not great.\" It will be terrible.My suggestion: in light of the above issues with fit and positioning, I recommend the use of a jury-rigged \"leash\" to hold the headphones securely on the head of the user. Such a leash fits the back of ones head. I fashioned my leash out of a cut-up Croakies eyewear retainer. I uploaded two photos to this review to illustrate my work, such as it is. I have used this idea with other headphones and I have had good results in all cases.Compatibility and stability: I have paired these headphones with three devices. The pairing process was effortless. These 'phones work well with my Motorola cell phone, my iPod Touch, and my notebook computer. In fact, I have used these 'phones with my cell phone and iPod at the same time. Listening to music, when a phone call comes in, I can touch one button on the 'phones to answer. Very convenient! With the notebook computer, I can use the controls on the 'phones to do pause/resume, skip forward/skip reverse, and volume up/volume down. With the iPod Touch, I can do all of these except skip forward/skip reverse. By the way, you cannot use the microphone function with the iPod Touch either. Just Apple being Apple, I guess.On the subject of iPod, here is a trouble-shooting tip: while listening to music with my iPod Touch, I encounter frequent dropouts. What happens is that the sound ceases for about one half of a second. It is irritating, and it happens to me several times per hour of use. The solution is to disable WiFi on the iPod Touch. It seems that the iPod bluetooth and WiFi radios have trouble working together. The \"dropout\" problem is especially bad if the WiFi signal is weak. It seems obvious to me that this is an iPod problem, not a Sony headphone problem.Value: these are the only stereo bluetooth headphones I can find that are fit to purpose AND less than $100. Sony also gives you a telephone quality microphone. In fact, I got these for a lot less than $100, so I consider this to be an excellent value. Frankly, I wish that there were more choices in the marketplace. No matter. The marketplace is what it is, and this product is the best deal that I could find.I suppose that I have presented a rather conflicted view of this product, but I am getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. I like to wear it while doing chores around the house. With conventional wired headphones, I have issues with my arms getting tangled in the headphone leads and pulling the 'phones or music player out of place.

I really wanted a headset that I could wear in the gym and be active in while still listening to my music.  I've had terrible luck with arm bands in the gym.  So I thought I'd give this a try.  I've already gone through a Motorola headset that died after two weeks.  The reviews on the Sony are positive so I thought I'd try it.This headset works quite well. The base unit is smaller than about the size of a man's thumb in my estimation.  The unit comes with a few different ear buds to switch out.  The cords do get tangled easily though.  Then again, most headsets have that problem.  The unit paired in seconds, charged well and keeps a decent charge.  On some of my songs, the sound is somewhat tinny but still good.Usage is a bit odd.  The cords are not long enough so that you could clip it to the end of a sleeve.  And if you wear it in the gym, you'll have to clip it to your collar of your shirt.  And this is a bit odd.  Basically you'll have a thumb sized bulge on or under your shirt at neck level.  I've gotten a few stares because it looks weird.  Then again, while running on the treadmill, it's super convenient.The iPhone is the bummer since it doesn't support the full volume control and track skipping.  But this unit works just fine beyond that.  I'm very happy with it.Update:  I must have doomed the stupid thing.  Minutes after I wrote this review, the unit won't power on any more.  I have no idea what happened but it's dead.  Thankfully it's under 30 days so I'm returning it.  Downgrading my rating to two stars.

(Yes, it's true -- I just don't like talking to people.)  But, I *do* like listening to music, and my macbook pro had a design flaw: the amplifier for the headphone port lacked shielding it needed, so any headphones plugged in played all kinds of whiny, buzzy, clicky sounds.  Finally, my husband suggested I try a bluetooth headset.  Going straight to digital should cut out the noise, right?Yep. Totally worked.  But also... wow.  The sound on these earbuds is fabulous, and they're soooooo comfortable and convenient, especially with the computer.  With the iPhone, and the iPad, the skip function doesn't work. (This is Apple's fault, not Sony's), but everything functions beautifully with the computer.  How nice to be able to wander all around the house and still (privately) listen to my music!There is a little trouble getting devices reconnected, though I suspect this is a flaw with the protocol itself, or Apple's implementation of it.  Often it takes me a few tries to get the headphones paired with whichever device I'm using.  I do have three different devices paired with the same set of headphones, though, and I have no additional trouble with switching between them.My only (slight) complaint is that plugging the headphones into USB to charge turns them off.As for durability... I clip the module onto my pocket, collar, or a sturdy necklace.  I have used this constantly for nearly a year now, and while I try not to beat it up, I haven't been especially gentle.

Finely tuned audiophiles may wish to look elsewhere.  Oh, and they are tricky to charge.  They only seem to fully charge from my PC's powered USB port.

Bought this because my original C-S2 battery and a backup of the same were failing.The original that came with the phone is listed at 1150mAh, and is supposed to have a talk time of three hours, with a standby time of 1 days. When my talk time had hit under an hour and standby time was less than a day, it was time to replace it. Since the BlackBerry C-S2 battery has a cryptographic chip to ensure you're using the right one for the particular BlackBerry smartphone you have, it should either work or be a dud.And when I received this battery, it was a dud.But going back to the original documentation for these, the BlackBerry C-S2 battery requires a full 8-hour or longer charge before it can be used, so I charged this one. That did the trick... to some degree.This replacement has never been quite up to the talk time of the original when it was new, but at about 2 hours, it wasn't worth sending back, so I've kept it. This one is better than another that I picked up here from another vendor, so it was better to hold onto one that worked as opposed to one that didn't.Your experiences may be different, and from some of the reviews posted here, that seems to be the case.

They are rated at 5.1V and 0.7A.  For each, I measured their output at 5.1V open circuit, 5.0 to 5.05V at 700 to 830 mA, and dropping to 4.1-4.4 V at about 850mA.  While many low cost chargers sold here are counterfeit items, these chargers (at least the ones I got) are not, they are the real thing.However, some of the cables provided were not reliable.  The cable that's supplied with the charger (LG cable part number SGDY0014303) connects to the charger using a standard USB Type A connector at one end, and at the other end connects to the phone using a micro-USB connector, which is fast becoming the standard for cell phone power.I purchased five sets of chargers and cables, and found that three of the five cables were bad.  Let me describe the bad ones:I haven't used the cables with an LG phone, but using them with several other devices and phones I found that the micro-USB connector was often intermittent.  There is a fair amount of play when the connector is plugged in, and if it wiggles just a little bit the power connection is lost.I microscopically compared that male micro-USB connector with others that I have on better cables. See the photo I posted of both good and bad connectors.The better cables have connectors that are far superior.  The connector on the three bad SGDY0014303 cables have metal contacts that have very little compliance so that only when the connector is plugged into the receptical perfectly does it make a good connection.  If the array of metal contacts are not perfectly coplanar with the corresponding contacts in the receptical, contact is easily lost.  Further, the hole in the connector was a bit too large, making the connector fit loosely.  When I examine the micro-USB male connectors of the other cables I have, I see that their contacts are made of a much larger bent metal spring that is more forgiving of misalignment -- it continues to make contact no matter how much the connector is wiggled in the receptical, and the connection is much tighter overall.I find that when I charge my HTC phone using the bad cables, I have to be very careful to make sure the connector is actually making contact, and adjust it if it is not, so the phone charges.The other two cables are constructed a little differently, and work fine.  All five cables are marked identically, with LG logos that look the same.  Further, the wire gauge and the plastic housing material looks the same.  Even so, examining the connectors under a microscope shows that I actually received three differently designed micro-USB connectors.  Two of the designs work well, but the third design, present on three cables, is faulty by design.For me, this charger is a great deal, but beware of unreliable cables!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Some cables have poor quality micro-USB connectors", "unixReviewTime": 1344470400, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2012"}

On top of that great deal, I am going to send my phone to Nokia Trade Up For Cash program, which means overall I have spent $200 on this really cool phone.I had Nokias my whole cell phone history and last year got a Motorola. I really did like my Z9 but it was almost obsolete from day 1 (but I really don't have anything bad to say about it, it was a good phone.) I missed Nokia with their simple menus and excellent quality.To be honest, the menus are no longer simple and sometimes seem counterintuitive LOL. And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone). The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though. And my learning curve is getting better with touch, so I don't see it being a problem after a while. I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes. The Music Player is the bomb! Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity. It sounds amazing. I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch.The screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well. I have my music transferred, my contacts transferred and am very happy. I like the compact size and heft of the phone. I don't like lightweight feeling phones. The camera seems fine to me. The battery life does seem to be on the shorter side but make sure you close web applications after use. The phone does so much that you can dejuice it quickly. My Touch does the same thing.Nokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the Music Store available for the US! Also if you message the downloads to yourself it is a pain, so it is better to download on the phone direct from the store. The App selection bites though, but that's what my ipod is for. The thrill of app-ness dies down anyway, so it's not really a big deal, but not having music store access is just silly.Otherwise this phone is very competitive to iPhone. Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory. I love my Touch of course but I got an 8g and I'm maxed out with music and apps and now I can't do anything to it unless I get rid of stuff. That kinda bites. So the 5800 has a true edge there.I already had AT&T; and it was no problem to pop my SIM card in the phone and move right along. I had everything except the TV out cord and the stand which it appears on the website that they do not sell that in the package anymore so that is more Amazon's fault for not upgrading the info, but I don't really need the stand or cord. The USB cord is entirely too short. The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice. Of course the charger is included and is acceptable. It easily connected with my internet, easily paired with my bluetooth, and once I finally figured out how to transfer music from my ipod to it, there were no problems there.I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone.PS I LOL at 8g holding 6000 songs. Maybe 6000 ringtone sound bytes. 8g will net you between 600-800 average songs....", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "happy to be back with Nokia", "unixReviewTime": 1256428800, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2009"}

Prior to the Nokia 5800 I had an old Nokia from 2005. I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function). After a year and a half, the results are mixed.The video cam is convenient to use but the results are just ok. In broad daylight the picture is clear. But in any other lighting condition degradation is rapid. Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input. This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth.The audio quality of the phone is pretty good. The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal, so I just turn off the auto-turn feature. Unfortunately there is no option to switch. Either it is stationary or it turns eratically on its own.With the updates the phone functions a little smoother. Originally there is the full/mini QWERTY keyboard along with handwriting, now with the update there is an alphanumeric keypad.

The Nokia 5800 is more fun than a Blackberry. And the iPhone? Well, it's really just a \"feature\" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone. The iPhone is great for what it can do, but terrible for what it can't do.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a truly useful and functional communication and entertainment device. It is the best convergence device I have used to date. It excels as a phone with great call quality and RF reception (I get 3G signals where other phones barely get 2G, or even no signal at all)! As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback. And as a web/communication device it has one of the best mobile browsers available (full HTML with support for Java and Flash) with applications available for popular IM and social networking sites (ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, Googletalk, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and more) and email with support for attachments (POP, IMAP, SMTP, MFE). And since it's all controlled by the Symbian multi-tasking OS, you can use just about any combination of applications and features you want (within the limits of the phone's memory)!Nokia has been supporting this phone well with several major (free) firmware updates since it was released late last year. Be sure to update to the latest firmware, because there have been significant improvements in performance and stability, as well as new features added.It's small and light weight with reasonably solid construction. While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket.It's about as loaded as you can get feature wise. Besides what I mentioned above, it's got tactile (Haptic) feedback. Accelerometer. GPS with A-GPS and navigation software (Nokia/Ovi Maps).

Media player (audio & video) with \"Flight\" mode for use during airline travel. Photo browser. Multiple input options (full screen QWERTY, mini QWERTY, T9 with predictive text, and handwriting recognition). Expandable memory (microSDHC 8GB included, can accept larger cards as well). User changeable battery. Really loud and surprisingly good sounding speakers. 3.5mm Nokia AV connector (for standard stereo headphones and audio/video TV output). Bluetooth 2.0 with support for Stereo audio (A2DP & AVRCP). Speed dial. Voice dialing (SIND speaker independent dialing and voice commands). PC sync software.The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS. But because Nokia markets this as an XpressMusic phone, you can use it with AT&T;'s cheap medianet data plans, or just use WiFi without any data plan at all if you prefer (I've got unlimited data for $10/month on the family plan).You simply cannot beat this phone's combination of features, performance and price!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "My favorite phone!", "unixReviewTime": 1253836800, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2009"}

This smartphone has everything required for a practical use of email, e-mail account wizards settings are very easily to use, and with the OVI suite you can have it all in one place.

I can tell you that after using it for this length of time that it is an excellent phone.  It can do more than any other touchscreen phone out there today.  The only two phones that can even come close are the iPhone 3G and the BB Storm.  This phone can do more than either of them two.  The camera gets dogged a lot, but in all actuality, it does a pretty good job when taking pictures in bright outdoor/indoor light.  The front facing camera is an outstanding feature and works very well.  The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh?).  The virtual qwerty is very nice and has all the keys in the right place. I also have an Eternity, but the layout of the 5800's keyboard is way better (don't make me dig for my apostrophe Samsung!) >:[.  Also, the haptic feedback is awesome too.  The vibration actually 'feels' localized and not just vibrating the whole phone.  The call quality is top notch, not sure why some reviews say other wise, but compared to previous phones I have owned, this was on par with my old Nokia E51, and better than my Eternity, Quickfire (what a joke), SE w580i or LG Vu.  I've had other phones too, but they were very basic phones and were also Nokias.The OS is still a tad bit immature, making its crossover to the touchscreen.  However, it is still very stable and functional for its 'immaturity'.  I love how they managed to keep all the previous capabilities of the S60 3rd and include it into a very well packaged bundle what is now called S60 5th Edition.  I love the 'tap and hold and slide' to copy and paste things.  It is so awesome!Syncing is great as usual.  I downloaded the iSync plug from Nokia website and was able to sync my calendar and contacts via bluetooth flawlessly!  Also, PC Suite worked like a charm as with any Nokia phone.The sound is best in class.  I don't think anything out there can compete with the sound quality that this phone puts out.It's still a new phone, been out only about 7 months now.  But they provide excellent firmware support (3 to date) and are constantly looking for ways to improve performance and enhance any existing features if not, they even add more useful features.As for all the other features (gps, radio, messaging, browsing); it does them all very well.  I have no complaints.  Probably the only drawback if there were one, is the fact that this phone can do so much with its Symbian OS that you really need to read up and research all the things it can really do and how to do them.  This phone's OS has a very rich Symbian ancestry.It's an excellent phone and I honestly believe that this phone is best in class and overall compared to the other phones currently out there.  I would even go so far as to say I am glad I did not wait for the N97.  I know blasphemy!  But it's true.If you get this phone, you will not regret it.  Just keep in mind that it does come with plenty of features and the OS is very 'sophisticated'.  Oh, by the way, I do have to admit, that it is very nice to have a 'Smart Phone' that can use the internet and check email without having to pay any PDA fees.Kudos Nokia!

Kelley \"mpkelley20\"", "helpful": [6, 8], "reviewText": "I decided to pick up an unlocked phone to go with my AT&T; service rather than go into another 2 year contract.  After months of deciding on IPhone or something different, I came to the conclusion that the missing features of the Iphone were too much for me.  I needed multi-media messaging, video recording capabilities and a better camera.  I also wanted the ability to change batteries at some point as I've had bad luck with devices that had built in batteries.  So I ruled out Iphone and went on a search for the perfect phone.  While I can easily say that there is no such thing as a perfect phone, the Nokia 5800 comes close.  I was going to wait until the N97 was released but the $600 or $700 price tag was too much to take.  I ended up buying the 5800 from Amazon at a reasonable $302 which was the same cost as the 16gb Iphone minus the 2 year contract.What I like about the phone:1. It has everything I need that the Iphone was missing including very good video recording capabilities.2. The Bluetooth works well with my car and head set.  No difference in sound and everything is very clear.3. Music Player is clean and clear but it could be a bit louder.4. Web browsing works well although not as smooth as the Iphone5. Flash support!!!!  Yes, you can watch youtube videos on it6. Amazon On Demand $50 gift certificate - While I don't see myself using the phone to watch movies, this was a nice treat and it looks very sharp on the screen7. Battery life is great compared to other phones that have these features and can be replaced8. Access to any type of e-mail including Exchange support9. The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers!)10. Ability to use apps such as QIK which allows you to stream video for live sharing (very cool feature)11. Customer support from Nokia has been top notch for me12. Expandable memory - comes with 8GB card and I expanded it to 16GB.  I've heard through the grapevine that it can also handle the new 32gb SD cards that just came outLast but definitely not least13.  Multi tasking!  Listen to music while tracking your fitness and browsing the web.  No problem....well except for the actual working out part!What I think needs improvement1.  Camera takes incredible pictures in bright light but is brutal in low light situations.  Supposedly firmware V.21 helps this problem but it is not available in the U.S. yet2.  Limited Apps available compared to Iphone.  Not a big deal but it would be nice if Nokia can get their App store up and running beyond the limited themes and music tones out there right now3.  Firmware Updates - U.S. versions seem to be last on the list since no major carriers over here carry this phone.  Waiting for V.21......4.  Touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for sensitivity5.  There is a learning curve for the Symbian software that runs the phone - Not as intuitive as the Iphone but once you get the hang of it is not too bad6.  Web browser - yes, it is one of the things I like but it also has some flaws with navigation.  Iphone got this one right and no one else has gotten closeOverall, in my opinion, this is one of the best phones on the market under $400.  I think the N97 coming out will be the king of phones but I doubt it will break into any major U.S providers since it would compete directly with Iphone, Storm, Pre, etc...  It's too bad for Nokia that they are left out and that means too bad for U.S owners of their phones since we get all the newest firmware releases last (if at all).  I don't see myself changing phones anytime soon as the 5800 seems to have everything I need for now.  Maybe if 4G or 5G or whatever is next on the horizon becomes available, I will consider changing.  For now, this is my choice.*****Update May 27, 2009*******Great news!!  The Nokia App store is now live (store.ovi.com).  I now feel like I have a complete phone as I can easily download apps and have them installed.  Prior to yesterday, the only way to get apps was to search for them on various sites, forums and other places.  The installs were always hit or miss and I could never tell if the app was compatible with the 5800.Now, with the new app store, I feel like the one thing missing has been fixed.  The number of apps seems to be very large upon the initial opening.  I heard that something like 20,000 apps were supposed to be released on launch day but there is no easy way to know how many are really out there.Prices seem a little bit higher than the IPhone store.  There are a good amount of free apps but the ones that cost money seem to range anywhere from $2.99 to $20.You can either shop the store on your computer and send a text link to you device or you can download the OVI app which will automatically connect you to the app store.Hopefully the amount of GOOD apps that are released will increase fast now that the store is open.  In my mind, the only benefit of the IPhone was the apps...but that it now in the past.Oh, and it seems like us U.S owners are getting abit more support.  The App updater works now and I was able to update to the newest version of Flash Lite which could only be done in the past through firmware updates. And speaking of firmware, I haven't checked to see if V.21 is available in the U.S. yet but tech support seemed to goof up a bit last week when they told me to download it to fix a minor issue I was having.  When I told them I couldn't see the update, they quickly corrected themselves and told me to keep checking.  So hopefully any day now!!Finally, I love this phone so much that I just picked up a second one for my wife.  With the $50 rebate, that puts the price to below $300 which is just amazing compared to what the IPhone would cost coupled with PDA monthly data charges. The 5800 is the winner.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best phone on the market until the next generation", "unixReviewTime": 1242864000, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2009"}

First, I normally would not buy a Nokia - I am a Sony Ericsson fan. However, I needed a quad-band  phone for a trip to Europe and I wanted a touch phone. The SE Satio has been released, but not in the USA and it is pricey.  So I went with the Nokia. I love the look and feel of the phone.  I have had absolutely no problems - no screen freezing and battery life has been very very good.  The battery charges quickly. It is easy to lock and unlock the phone manually.  There is an automatic lock feature which you can disable or set a longer time before it automatically locks.  Calls are easy and call quality is great.  A prior reviewer said it is to hard to make a call, but I do not find that to be the case. You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number. I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great.  I am not a big web user but it connects quickly.  I have not tried the GPS yet. I do have to say the camera is not so great, so if you are looking for a good camera phone I would not buy this phone.  Also, I do not know why the phone icon is found in applications and not on the main menu (maybe I can change that). I am still learning to use all of the many features this phone has to offer.

As much as I like Nokia, they still have a long way to go with touch screens.INITIAL REVIEW: After one year using a Nokia E-71 which I dropped and stopped working, I searched for a replacement and found this XpressMusic5800 for $219.00 OnLine.  Ordered it from the blue computer store and have been \"playing with it\" for only 24 hours.  Nevertheless, being a recently introduced device in the US, thought on sharing my first impression for those who are considering it.Users familiar with Nokia products will love how user friendly this phone is.  Those unfamiliar with Nokia, might have a hard time setting up the many phone's features but it's worth your time.  Once you open the box, will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be.  The most attractive thing is how narrow it is.  Slightly shorter than an I-Phone and E-71, much narrower than both but somewhat thicker; a tad more than half inch.  Included is a wired remote control for the player, mic/headphones, the wall charger, strap, MicroSD card and a mini disk for installing the Nokia features.On the upper part of the device there is a micro USB dock, the port for the regular headset, the charging port and the on/off switch. On the right side there is a volume switch, the unlocking switch and a separate camera switch.  The left side houses an 8GB MicroSD card (included) and the SIM Card from your phone carrier.  The expected Nokia strap hooks on the lower left side of the phone.  The battery is on the back, facing downwards and to access it you need to remove the whole back cover.  The phone comes in shiny black which is a fingerprints magnet.When you turn it on it vibrates, shows the usual Nokia welcome and then allows you to program it.  I was able to configure my two main e-mails but guess you can do several more.  On my E-71 I had four different mail accounts constantly receiving messages.  The native wallpaper is black with some waves but you can easily change it to your favorite photo.  I downloaded several screens from the Apple website since the screen is somewhat similar to the I-Phone and I-Pod in shape and dimensions.On a very T-Mobile way, you can have your \"four favorite people\" on the main screen and once you touch their corresponding picture/icon, the phone shows a history of calls made, received, text messages and e-mails; quite innovative.  On the lower area you have an icon for phone dialing and another for your contacts.  The phone dialing keyboard works only in the vertical position but the font keyboard is accessed also while the device is horizontal.  Making a call trough the contact list is very easy the device is loaded with features.Call quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion.  The touch sensing screen is not as fast and accurate as the Apple devices but good enough for not needing the stylus that is housed on the rear of the phone.  As a music player it is outstanding.  Playback is trough the two micro speakers on the lower sides and sound quality as well as stereo separation are very good.  Nokia offers on this device all the goodies that make them unique such as saying the caller's name/ID, unique caller ringtones & photos and several customizable user modes. There are many features that I have not yet tried but will do during the next week or so.  My service is with ATT and works in both frequencies; EDGE & 3-G,Now, the limitations of the Nokia 5800:First; the battery life.  Nokia products have been famous for their extended batteries.  My E-71 could be used without recharging up to three days.  On the 5800, the battery drains in six hours. The stated four hours of talk time and two weeks of standby time are far from reasonable.What I did to prolong battery life was disable the vibrations when the screen gets a command, disable the 3-G (use EDGE only) and made the Bluetooth available for search for only one minute.  As of today, with regular calls, internet use, e-mails and music, after 15 hours of nonstop use, the battery still has like 40% charge.Second and quite disappointing, the installation mini disk as well as the software upgrades on the Nokia Website is not compatible with Windows 7.  After downloading all the suites, OVI, and ancillary software, many of these do not work with Win-7. Then tried these with a NetBook running Win-XP and no problem with the updates.Having stated all this, I consider that for the price paid ($219.00), the Nokia 5800 is a bargain when compared with their 51XX and 53XX series, mostly because of its music playing capabilities, awesome call features and quality.  But in my case, the battery issue might make me consider other alternate phones.  Let's see what I decide and meanwhile, I hope that this initial review helps you to decide if the Nokia 5800 is the phone for you.  In case that you are considering an I-Phone, you should wait.

I take off .50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch. the other .25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down. So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly.  This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother.

{"reviewerID": "A1MRPX3RM48T2I", "asin": "B001SEAOC6", "reviewerName": "Winter", "helpful": [7, 10], "reviewText": "IMPORTANT NOTE:  This phone is carrier-unlocked.  It means that the phone itself does not require you to go with any one specific carrier in order to use it:  you just buy it, swap your SIM card (if compatible), and start using.  HOWEVER: if you are not currently on an unlimited data plan with your carrier, you absolutely MUST call your wireless carrier and talk to them about the phone.  The Nokia XpressMusic 5800 has a lot of settings that default to using your wireless carrier to pull down data, and using these features (or in some cases just having them turned on) when your carrier bills you for data by the kilobit WILL lead to astronomically high phone bills.  I had a long conversation with AT&T; Service prior to purchasing this phone and their representative indicated to me that many people don't realize the hidden cost of their phone's features when not signed up for an unlimited data plan.  Before you buy, take 10 minutes to call your carrier.  It can save you a lot of headaches.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is an excellent phone for people who love media: it's got a browser for streaming, easy-to-use software for transfers of your own files, and it even has a built-in FM radio for listening to local stations (with the added bonus of being able to tag and label them). The screen is approximately the size of the screen on a Nintendo DS or the older Sony PSP, with the difference being that colors are brighter, resolution is sharper, and the backlight is superior. Power button, standard headphone adapter, charge plug and USB connector are all on the top, making it easy to access but conveniently out of the way. The touch screen is unlocked via a rocker key on the side, and volume can easily be adjusted up or down along the same edge.In addition to this, you can expect all the same features you find in most smartphones today: GIS-driven mapping systems, Internet connectivity via WiFi (if, like me, you're not on an unlimited data plan), a multitude of Bluetooth capabilities, integration with a PC or Mac via the USB Cable, and of course a digital camera that takes good (but not great) pictures and video. One nice extra here is that if you hold the phone like a camera, a button on top will quickly switch the phone to camera mode and also double as your auto-focus and picture-taking button.I like the feel of this phone, and I definitely like the clarity and strength of the calls. There are times when it appears that I have only one bar, but still can place clear and noise-free calls that don't disconnect. The software is regularly kept up to date, and once you get through the process of setting up an account at the Ovi Store, it is remarkably easy to download and install applications, many of which are free (but only some of which are useful).The one big drawback--and it is a serious one--is the interface. Features and Applications are in two separate sections, and sometimes the dividing line between which is which is not exactly clear. The auto-rotate that switches from Portrait to Landscape can go off at the slightest of bumps, and I have to shake the phone and wait for it to re-set. I bought the phone because I wanted a good, solid handwriting device, and this is where I have been most disappointed. Despite being a whiz at PDAs, despite training (and re-training) the phone to my handwriting, I get many botched translations. I have to force myself to scribe slowly because the delay time between reading my strokes and rendering a character is noticeably long. I have to patiently re-do most of my strokes over and over. To give credit where credit is due, Nokia gives you a slim stylus cleverly hidden along the side of the phone, and then they throw in a hip little gadget called a \"plectrum\": it's a triangular guitar-pick that makes a handy substitute for a fingernail--consider this for pointing and clicking and the stylus for handwriting.There is, however, one sin that seems unforgivable, and I'm surprised that a year and a half down the road, the updates still haven't addressed it:The phone dialer has no letters on it.Let me rewind that: if you call up the dialer in other areas of the phone (such as via contacts), you will see the letters imprinted on the dial pad. However, if you want to dial a number with letters in it (say, \"1-800-FLOWERS\"), you are out of luck: the dialer shown when dialing the phone does not display any letters. The fact that the letters are imprinted elsewhere in the system, but not where they are most important, is what makes the lack of this \"fix\" annoying.Also, while the software is easy to use, it is also incredibly slow and buggy in Windows Vista or Windows 7. The interface often turns black and I have to scrub my mouse over the window to re-draw my menus and panels.If you really like media and want a phone for music, pictures, and video, the 5800 XpressMusic is not bad. However, if you're looking for a pocket-sized computer that can do whiz-kid propeller-head tricks, the 5800XpressMusic will most likely disappoint, especially given its price. As much as I appreciate what Nokia was trying to do with this phone, it really wasn't significantly different from my Motorola RAZR.NOTE: I cannot confirm that this is true of all Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phones, but the \"USA\" Phone that was shipped to me contained a European power adapter. This huge chunk of plastic contains a converter to allow it to plug into US electrical outlets, but it also means that your charger is anything but pocket-sized. I sent mine in for a replacement, only to discover that the replacement also contained the same \"Euro-plus-converter-widget\" charger.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good but not Great", "unixReviewTime": 1264032000, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2010"}

I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $30 data plan with At&t; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product.  First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls  :  10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception, compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market.  I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera (stills) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors, but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy.  Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera (video) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent, I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video, stills, front & rear camera: Switching from a video to still and back to video.  Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive.  I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender, Memo... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer, but cannot sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers.  Which means, everytime, you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good, lacks a audio book player.  It does not playback divx movies (sorry torrent folks :)Youtube playback: 2/10================Ok, I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving.  I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks, made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version & try it on wifi - But even on Wifi, while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as  new mail  &lt;href image= ....>This phone does not even support html emails, no images either.  Other than that, the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail & Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard  : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard, full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting.  I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps  : 2/10====Yes, there is an app store, but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity, but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen: 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen, means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work, unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia's resistive touch screen works, but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio, but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna.  Even after plugging in the antenna, it picks up a few strong signals, but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors, nor outdoors.GPS  ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia.  Oh oh, big mistake.  The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS (means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location, it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions.  It works, but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly, I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone.  We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At&t; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you.

I've only been using my first set for about six hours, and most of that has been getting \"quality opinions\" from those that I trust while using them on my Incredible in several situations that I encounter regularly.Everyone I called, without exception, literally raved about the quality of my \"sound\", and several compared it to the very best land-line connection they've experienced.  On the receive end, the default volume setting when I plugged them in was almost to the point of pain; I had to turn the volume nearly off for comfortable listening, so there would be absolutely no problem using these in very noisy places (at least on my end).  I like the fact that without the silicone earbud option, they're still comfortable for extended wear, but you have nearly normal hearing when they're set at a reasonable level, so driving safety is not hampered.  If I wanted to block out any other sounds, I'd use my expensive noise canceling headphones, but my intent for these was mostly hand-free phone use; being able to hear traffic, sirens, etc can be a huge safety bonus!If there is a flaw to this ridiculously-cheap headset, it's the fact that the microphone is not noise canceling. My work van is noisy at highway speeds, and I did get reports of hearing a \"roar\" in the background (but that listener did point out that there was no problem with him to be able to understand me perfectly; it was just that the background noise was \"distracting\" when I wasn't talking.  I did slow down to about 35 mph as a test, and that background noise \"went away\".Although my Incredible, until the new software update that's coming soon, doesn't support voice dialing, it does have a \"voice search\" feature with one button push on the \"Car Panel\"...  ...I've found that the extra-clear audio of this headset resulted in perfect, mistake-free name recognition with that program, and error-free dialing in at least a half-dozen test calls.After the great reports I've gotten during my full evening of \"testing\", I'm parking my Bluetooth for most applications; so far, I haven't found the cord to be a problem when my phone's in it's holster or in the windshield mount. (I could possibly change my mind about that after a few weeks of use, but the superior quality achieved with this headset is worth a little extra hassle with a cord.)When contact after contact kept telling me that they've never had a better, clearer, telephone conversation (and far superior to my Incredible when \"hand held\" in its normal mode, I plan to place every call I can with this headset!By the way, the music quality is also very good with this headset, way superior to anything within $25 or so of this price.Can you tell I'm excited and enthused? :-)I've had so many truly \"rotten\" conversation with people on cell phones during the past 40 years; \"if I were King\", I'd mandate that everyone who called me used this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unbelievable value; exceeded my expectations", "unixReviewTime": 1276560000, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2010"}

I opened the box, put the battery in, my sim card and SD card and it worked.Over the past couple days I have made a list of the pros and cons.Pro:It has a real cool screen with awesome color that swivels open and made everyone at work say Ooooo!Cons:* I think there are more buttons than you need, many are repetitious, but they look impressive. Most of the functions take several steps. I work with computers and accessories all day, I am not intimidated by something different. But this was not a well thought out design.* A tiny button on the top opens the camera. It's a very tiny black button, flat to the surface and the same color as the phone so its hard to find and difficult to push, I used my fingernail when I found it. You can take both photos and video. I somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while to get it back to photo. The picture it took was good quality.* There are no one step calls as with other phones. There are several ways to make a call which I won't go through, but it is neither easy nor convenient. The swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call. The basic function of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy. The Sidekick gets an \"F\" for that. And the same grade for reception. My last phone, a very basic and inexpensive phone, gets reception in places this one can't receive or make a call, like in my house.* I don't think this phone should be categorized under slider, I have a slider and closing it is a simple one hand move. This doesn't slide, it swivels.* With all the functions they have available, there is only one alarm.* I had TMobile turn on data so I could download features I need like another alarm, but The phone was never able to access the Internet so I cancelled that service.* It makes loud annoying sounds for whatever you do, opening the screen, keystrokes and just about everything. So I adjusted the settings to silent and turned the ring volume up, a multi step process through the menu. When I am at work I turn the volume down, then later when I turn the volume up, it resets all the sounds back on.* Texting is not easy to access, another multi step process. Getting texts is in a whole different location than writing a new text.* There are many buttons, and some just duplicate what others do. It looks impressive, but that's all.* The screen and buttons are not customizable so there is no way to set up one step shortcuts for features you use often.Everything that other phones do with a simple one or two steps, this phone requires attention to what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu. Doing almost anything with this phone is like carrying your PC around, and trying to get into programs without shortcuts on the desktop.This is not a phone you can hand to a friend and tell them, here, use my phone.

{"reviewerID": "A35SO3QWPD8VY", "asin": "B001TC6NPE", "reviewerName": "Will B. \"Carpenter\"", "helpful": [17, 17], "reviewText": "I consider myself fairly adept at applying screen protectors to Apple devices, having done it several dozen times now.I've knocked a star off these for the simplest of reasons: As with all these 'screen protectors' there are two stickers covering the actual screen protector which are removed in order; #1 before you apply it to your screen and #2 after it is applied. The problem with this bunch is that the \"Peel here\" for #1 is located at the top of the screen. As I aligned the screen protector beginning with the speaker, it fell short of the home button, and had to be re-applied. If you've done this before, you know that the 'bad' bubbles that form (the impossible to remove bubbles) are due to tiny dust particles that adhere to the 'sticky' protector during application. Several tiny pieces of dust will ruin a protector during application.I have a few essential tips to alleviate some of the common mistakes:1) Clear an area to apply the protector on a workable surface. We use a glass table in our living room.2) Wipe the area with 409 or windex, removing all dust and debris.3) Allow airborne dust in the area to subside. Don't do anything that will stir up dust.4) Wash your hands thoroughly and dry them thoroughly.5) Gather the necessary tools for the application. (I use one of the \"plastic plying tools\" (found in a kit such asComplete Tool Screw Driver Torx Kit to Repair Replace Apple Iphone 2g 3g GPS Ipod Video Nano Touch Cracked Scratch Broken Lcd Screen Displaybecause I find the smaller surface area of the tip better than a credit card)6) Begin at the bottom or Home Button side of the phone.7) NEVER TOUCH the unprotected side of the screen protector once sticker #1 has been removed8) If you misalign the piece during application it is possible to grip the protector by the very edges.9) Be extremely careful not to drop, lose grip or allow the protector to fall onto the phone.10) Once the home button is encircled, align one vertical edge of the protector (ok to do before removing the sticker completely)11) Use great care once the edge is aligned to hold the protector at the bottom edge, remove sticker #1 and only apply the protector to the very edge of one vertical side.12) use your fingers only, with a gentle bend in the screen protector to carefully lie upon the phone.With the absence of dust in the environment, there will be no bad bubbles. With a gentle bend in the protector there will be no bubbles as the protector is applied.-This product has a tactile resistance that is unlike my previous protector.I cannot attest to the durability of this product - Yet.I like them and have used a single protector from a pack of 3 for 2-3 months.At less than 50 each - there is NO reason to ever spend $14 for protectors from Apple. YOu are being completely robbed blind by suppliers who charge more than pennies for this product.I am very please with this product, would recommend and would buy again. Thanks Amazon.ps: even following my precautions, due to the sticker at the top causing a misalignment on the first try I somehow picked up a single teeny-tiny dust bit. The application was 99.999% perfect... and will do just fine because in a week or so it will be scratched up and you won't see this tiniest of particles when LCD is illuminated anyway. It would take an extremely discerning eye to locate the error... but there are two more should I care... and at pennies apiece I welcome a second try when I'm ready.--Update: It's April 2012 - This is the best screen protector I've used. The shiny surface seems extraordinarily scratch resistant. The one I applied when I wrote this review is still VERY nice. It's been long enough to change it, but I am convinced these are the best ones I've used... and MUCH better than the $14.95 version!

This model does not include a Bluetooth transceiver to deliver A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) capabilities when connected to any player that has a standard 3.5 mm audio output jack. If such a device is needed to, for example, listen to Internet radio off a computer, then theAltec Lansing 906/R US BackBeat Headphone with Dongleis recommended.You get the following in the box:- Stereo headphones- with one pair of silicone ear buds (still trying to find a source for replacements)- Charger working through a USB Micro connection- English/Spanish manual, pretty good, actuallyMy review will first discuss features that I deem important then, I will close with a brief evaluation.Headphones:=========While not 'high end', they deliver a reasonably good quality sound. Some may have issues with headphones that go 'in' the ear rather than covering the ear. I know that I do but I seem to tolerate these quite well for as long as the volume is kept low.On the positive side, the 2 headphones are connected with a stereo cable that goes on the back of the head. This makes the entire assembly nearly invisible when worn, especially if the person who wears them has hair :). The microphone seems to be integrated in the headphones body and it seems to work well because no one asked me to speak louder while on the phone, using the BackBeat.The main concern is 'anatomy'. I have a big head and big ears and setting the earphones was not easy in the beginning even though the telescoping and swiveling adjustments do allow for some flexibility in wearing. I find that the more I get used to them, the easier it is to wear them. Again, a positive, once set, their extremely light weight makes for a very comfortable wear, so comfortable they almost 'disappear', unless they fall off.Pairing and maintaining connections:===========================- I had no problem pairing the headphones with a Blackberry and a Motorola Razor. It all works as the manual advises. When pairing the the phone, the headphones' password is always '0000' and it can't be changed.Controls:======It may take some getting used to but, here are the simple conventions:- Phone controls are mostly on the left-ear headphone- Music device controls are mostly on the right-year headphone- Rising tones usually mean that the feature is enabled/set/increased while falling tones mean the oppositeWhen connected to a phone you can answer the call, hang up, reject the call while listening to music, mute, raise/lower the volume, check the battery charge.For music features you can pause play, advance or go back one track (not tested by me yet), increase/decrease volume, enable/disable bass boost, pick up the phone or reject a call while listening. Play resumes after a call ends.It took very little time for the controls to become second nature.Performance and other characteristics:=============================A full charge completes in about 3 hours and little blue lights indicate the charge is full. Partial charging is possible in less than one hour. Claimed battery life on both devices is about 7 hours and my usage so far tends to confirm this.A carrying pouch is missing and it's missed. I would have felt much better if one was included because the headphones are small enough to be easily lost. I understand that the design was meant to allow carrying the headphones in a shirt pocket but I would have felt much more comfortable if I could store them somewhere other than a small pocket.__________________________________I hesitate between 4 and 5 stars. The more I use the BackBeat the more I enjoy using it. However, the missing carrying case - not easy to explain on a device within this price range and the lack of information on where or how to obtain spare ear buds call for a small deduction. With only a few small improvements, Altec could have a big winner in this product.The lack of a Bluetooth transceiver was not a factor when rating this product even though I WOULD recommend the higher end model which adds a lot more versatility for only a few dollars more.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Bluetooth, near hi-fi wireless stereo headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1240876800, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2009"}

I like the fact that these are buds and I don't have cans on my ears.  I'd like to listen to music while walking through airports without looking too much like a dork, and these fit the bill, although the design looks a bit like a hearing aid.Sound quality is fine, but the rubber ear piece doesn't fit entirely into your ear --  just a narrow tube points into your ear canal so the outside sound is not blocked and the volume is never too loud, even at the highest settings.  Personally, I wish the max volume was a bit louder, but the set is fine.Pairing was a breeze, and I can leave my iphone on the top floor and walk around the main floor of my house wearing the 903's without any loss of signal.  Really a nice feature!  Battery life so far has been solid, no worries there.  I like the fact that I can fast forward, rewind, and adjust the volume from the ear piece.  Also handles calls well, pauses the music, then re-starts after the call is completed.For me, I may still try the Ericsson IS800's and/or the LG Tone as both of those models have more traditional earbuds that look like they'll provide a richer sound while blocking out the world.So overall, sound gets a 4, features receive a 5, battery life a 5, range gets a 5, design gets a 3.  Depending on what's important to you, this may be a great option.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Some good, some just OK", "unixReviewTime": 1331424000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2012"}

I was so pleased with the Backbeat's comfort and sound quality that I decided to purchase another pair despite owning another set of Bluetooth headphones - the Jabra BT1101.

I heard a lot of bad and I heard a lot of good.  Keep in mind that I have only had these for a day or so and will update if things change.Pros:I don't know what people are talking about...I have the iPhone 4 with the newest 4.1 update and the track foward/reverse buttons work great and the volume works great and ALL the buttons work with this headset. So the reviews that are saying some buttons don't work probably have a different phone than I do or older software.Also the design (for me) is SO comfortable! I have tiny ears so I was worried about the headset being too heavy for me.  It's not.  It is very lightweight and comfortable. I also LOVE the fact that the wire behind the head is sturdy enough that I'm not afraid I'll harm it if I tug too hard but flexible enough that I can lay in bed and watch movies or when I'm at the gym I can do my floor exercises without them pushing off my ears. The headphones even work with my Netflix on my phone so I can watch movies while I'm in class or at work! Totally awesome! Also, I like the in-the-ear feel better than on-the-ear.  So I enjoy having the headphones block out all the other sound.  I also like the open-mic feature so when I stop my music to talk to someone I can hear them clearly without them or me sounding muffled.I was able to walk through my whole house without losing connection and finally when I was at the other end and downstairs and there were walls between me and my phone that the phone finally beeped at me telling me it was losing connection.I like how since I'm a girl and have hair that you can barely tell that they are on my ears...they are not clunky and don't make me look like a techno-geek.Cons:They were a little hard to get on but that was fine with me since they were hard to get off also and I don't want them coming off since I am active.I wear glasses a lot of the time when I exercise and I had to put the headphones on FIRST and THEN the glasses.  Sometimes the glasses would push the headphones off my ears even though the they would stay in my ears and that was kind of annoying.  But it only happened about once every half hour or so.  I can live with that.I read a lot of reviews that said the battery acted up on these phones and the buttons stop working after a few weeks.  I've only had mine for a few days so I am keeping a watchful on those issues and will update later if I do have any.  I bought these from Wal-mart so hopefully they have a good return policy.

I will be taking this back after a day of use for these reasons:1) These are uncomfortable. I hate ear phones and love earbuds(or canal phones or In-Ear-Monitors). These seem to be somewhere in-between. After about 30 minutes my ears hurt. Granted, I've been using Sony earbuds for the last 8 years, so that's what I am comparing them to. I can wear my buds for 8+ hours with no discomfort, I've been wearing the Backbeats for 3.5 hours today and they've been uncomfortable throughout. You only get one size and I'd say I have average to small ear canals.2) These only sound alright. Again I'm coming from 8 years of the same $60 earbuds from Sony. These have a lot more treble and sound tinny to me. I had a much better experience with the older Plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth which used earbuds similar to the Sonys. I like more defined bass that gives rock and alternative music a punch. The Backbeats make music I am familiar with sound much less dynamic. I had to use the bass boost option on all music. I think most people will be fine with the sound, but more discerning listeners should look elsewhere. There is a feature called OpenMic which is supposed to allow you to hear the outside world better when you press a button. I had no problems hearing around me with this option turned on or off, one of the 2 settings just adds a low static hum.3) I made one phone call for 30 minutes while driving in my car with the windows up and after 5 minutes my friend told me to take them back because I was difficult to understand and my voice sounded \"hollow\". They were functional, but not transparent. On my end, I had no problems understanding my friend so no complaints receiving.On a positive note, all of the buttons on the Backbeat worked as expected with my HTC Incredible. I was able to pause, back track and forward track songs, adjust volume. Pairing was easy. I use Meridian music player on my Incredible and the Backbeat controls it well. If you go into the Meridian player's preferences you can turn off the headset controls and that will allow you to control Pandora, Last FM and Slacker. Slacker sounded terrible - it seemed to have a dramatic lack of bass which I've read is a known problem with Slacker when not using Wi-Fi.Battery life seems great. I've been listening to music and made 40 minutes of phone calls for the last 4 hours and the Backbeat battery indicator shows that it is still 1/3 to 2/3's full. I'm not willing to use these any longer due to ear discomfort.The over the ear design wasn't too bad when I had my thick Arnette sunglasses on. But add a baseball cap on top and you've got a problem. The cord behind the neck is solid, but as others have noted, if you want to lay with the back of your head against a pillow or headrest, it will significantly apply pressure to your ears and this really highlights how uncomfortable the Backbeat is to wear.The separate dongle that you get with the 906 model worked as expected. I had to go through the pairing process each time I switched between my Incredible and the dongle. I'm not sure if there is a better way, but it didn't seem automatic after the initial pairings.Bottom line, don't bother trying these out unless you can take them back for a full refund. They look good on, but if they don't fit you just right, I think you are going to be disappointed. I've also read that there may be some huge reliability issues with the Backbeat and they do not seem to hold up to sweat so you should probably avoid these at all costs.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Uncomfortable.

I bought it and a Plantronics Voyager Pro at the same time.  The Plantronics Voyager Pro failed 1 year and 1 month later.  The folks at Plantronics basically said \"tough, would you like to buy our latest model?\"  They had no interest in the fact that I was dissatisfied, and had contacted them several times about the call clarity of the unit.  (They blamed it on my iPhone, even after I exchanged the phone for another one to resolve the issue.  Then they said it was an iOS issue that would be taken care of in an upgrade.  Then later said, too bad, your exchange time is up, live with it and hope \"Apple\" fixes the issue.  Turned out it wasn't an \"Apple\" issue.)  Since everyone I talked to regularly was complaining about the call clarity on their end of the call when I used the Voyager Pro, I decided to look on it as a chance to replace it with something from a different company.  (They also complained when I called from the airport on the Plantronics BackBeat 903, but I used it so seldom for a call it wasn't important, the stereo sound, without tangling wires, was nice on the plane and in the airport.)The Plantronics 903 BackBeat, purchased at the same time as the Voyager Pro, was purchased solely to use on airplane trips.  It has only about 80 hours of total use, and looks brand new...including \"standby\" time, it has only been turned on about 81-82 total hours in the last 3 years.  It has been stored in a special travel case...which I purchased for it, in my dresser drawer with some clothing.  I got it out yesterday to check it for pairing with my phone for a trip I intend to take next month.  It did exactly the same as the Voyager Pro when it died; worked for a few minutes, fluttered, quit, and refused to re-charge or turn back on.  I had bought Plantronics products because I have an 8 year old Plantronics bluetooth headset (that I still use as a backup)....it still works fine and nobody complains about the call clarity when I need to use it.  The quality of their older models was excellent, both in use and longevity...you really got your money's worth from their earlier products.  (I bought a Jawbone Era to replace the Voyager Pro, and everyone has always been very happy with the call clarity...it is two years old now, so I recently bought a Bose bluetooth headset, and again...everyone is happy with the call clarity.)My point being, that something seems to have happened with Plantroics manufacturing quality a few years ago.  Their older bluetooth headsets were well made, reliable, had good range, good battery time, and the call clarity was wonderful.  The products I bought 3 years ago, including the Plantronics 903 BackBeat just turned out to be a big waste of money.  Unless Plantronics has revisited their \"roots\" and begun making quality products again, knowing what I do now, I certainly wouldn't consider this headset.  The 903 BackBeat would not have held up to someone using it for jogging or exercise...it didn't hold up, even for occasional use while traveling on an airplane.  Anyone considering this headset should take a look at other products.  I'm not sure Plantronic's newer stereo headset model is better, but I don't think I will risk it.I'll either used a wired headset when listening to stereo music, or enjoy the sound in only one ear from the new Bose headset I bought....it really is fantastic how rich the Bose sound is when playing music...even though it is only in one ear.  I really hope they come out with a stereo bluetooth dual ear model.  After my past experience with Plantronics poor customer service, I'm sure a call to them about a hardly used, 3 year old, 903 BackBeat would be another futile waste of time.  I really don't expect my electronics to last more than a couple of years with constant use.  But, anyone should expect more than around 80 hours of use time from a product they spend, $99.99 for....the price was still on the box from the \"Apple Store.\")  If I decide to buy another bluetooth stereo headset, it will be some brand other than Plantronics.  I'm glad I read the reviews and didn't buy their latest single ear headset when I bought the Bose instead last month.

I like to listen to audiobooks during my long commute.  If I have a lot of telephone calls, a full charge is not enough to last all the way home in the evening.  The issue with the BlueFox is that there is no iGO tip available, so I can't charge them at work unless I carry around the wall charger.  The BackBeats charge with a standard micro USB tip (A97).  They fit on my head much the same as the 401s except that the flexible ear pieces fit a little more comfortably. The controls work very well with my Droid Eris, while only some of the 401 controls worked properly.  I love the behind-the-head style headset because my hair hides the headset so nobody can see it.  The behind-the-head part on the BackBeat is flexible.This headset is multi-point, you can pair to more than one device at a time.If you are trying to decide between the BackBeat 903 and the 906, the only difference is that the 906 comes with a bluetooth adapter for devices that don't support bluetooth.

And the sadder thing is - it's completely unnecessary.  There are so many other ways for them to indicate to you that the battery is low - non-intrusive ways.

In car they are especially useful, and then while exercising or going about the house and being able to use phone or MP3 player. The advantage of stereo Bluetooth headphones is that you can use them for music and phone both, not to say the good sound quality. After usingPlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetfor almost 4 years I wanted something low profile that is easy to use while exercising. Here is what I found about these BackBeat headphones.PROS1. Low profile and and nice design.2. The accompanying users guide does not really explain how to place these headsets. But they just sit over the ears, outside the canal, and you do not insert the silicone ear buds inside the ear. Once you place them, these are very comfortable in upright position. But finding the right location for ear buds takes some time and fiddling around in both axes, verical as well as rotation. It took me a while to find that and I wish company had explained in literature or had a video demo on their web site.3. Easy to pair.4. Good, clear voice quality and noise suppression.5. Good quality music sound in entire frequency range.6. Ubiquitous Micro-usb charger.7.. Pleasant audible tones let you know when there is a new call or when the unit is turned on and off.CONS1. Bluetooth connection keeps disconnecting. For example you use in one phone call and and for the next call the headphones are not working.  For me, this was the biggest drawback which made me return these headphones.2. Although they say you can connect two devices simultaneously, in practice it does not work well. To give you the example, say you are listening music on iPod Touch, you get a phone call, and when you hang up the iPod Touch is disconnected.3. Short range, the sound quality drops after about 9-10 feet and Bluetooth disconnects after about 20 feet.4. Accidentally pressing the Call and Play/pause buttons while adjusting the headphones in ear is very easy and happens all the time. But volume button nicely placed and works well.5. Track forward and back does not work with iPod Touch.6. Microphone does not work on iPod Touch.7. Does not work for music on Palm Centro, only the phone part.8. On Macs, you pair it as headsets and it will work well for a while. Then mysteriously the Bluetooth audio profile changes to Headphones and Headsets and it will stop working in either profile. If you pair as Headphones, the microphone does not work.9. While it is comfortable in upright position, you cannot use in lying down position because the back cord is thick, moves, and the headphones come out off the ears. Same while exercising on treadmill, keeps coming off the ear.10. Poor battery life, about 4-5 hours use. You have to charge them for 3 hours to be able to use them for 4 hours!11. No indicator light to let you know when it is on. Blue lights comes on for a second when you first turn it on and then goes off.There are a lot of nice things about these headphones but they need to improve the software so it does not disconnect, thin the back connecting cord, explain how to place the headphones in or over the ear, and make that telescoping and rotating mechanism a little sturdy so it holds in the same position. Since thePlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetrarely disconnected, the repeated disconnection was really the clincher for me, which made me return these headphones and replace them with New Samsung WEP870 Mono + Stereo BT Headset which I found on sale at Verizon Wireless web site, lot cheaper than here.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Work Great, When They DO, Which is About 60-70% of the Time", "unixReviewTime": 1266710400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2010"}

Appears to be real leather.  The coloring is very nice and the workmanship is very nice too.These are made in sweden and maybe that's part of the details that are frustrating.  The vendor went and put a big metal Krusell plate in front of the case.  Clearly visible in the pictures but there appears to be a backing to that metal plate in the back that is only covered by the single layer \"sand\" liner.  Why?????  I can see how over the years that's going to be an issue (the inside leather liner will probably tear exposing the metal backing - argh).  Also, if you put your thumb on the metal plate and squeeze you can tell that you're transmitting pressure energy to the screen of your iphone.  very suboptimal and really detracts from the protective features of this case is intended for.  I really wish the vendor had not decided to slap their big metal logo plate right in the middle of the case (which winds up resting on the screen).  It detracts from the protection this case is supposed to offer.  So yes, I've flipped my phone and put it in backside up into the case - so that the hard metal logo plate can't press against my screen. Still...The second wierd thing is a small metal loop ring in the back.  It comes with a round carabiner style ring.  I have no idea what I'd use that for.  My iphone 4 fits nice and snug but nowhere near snug enough that I'd put this case on some kind of carabiner or keyring - odd.  It would be much cleaner without.Overall, if you have a bluetooth headset and you don't have to look at your phone all the time, this is a nearly perfect case.Putting in and removing my Iphone 4 is not too hard but it is snug -- I do have an Apple bumper on my phone though and I know it would fit a bit looser if I didn't have the bumper but alas, I like the bumper and the case.Aside from those two things mentioned above, this case is fantastic!I went ahead and got theKrusell 95294 Gaia Universal Slim Leather Pouch Large for iPhone 4, Verizon iPhone 4, iPhone 3G/3G S, Samsung Galaxy S, T-Mobile G2, HTC Droid Eris and other Mobile Phones (Black)which doesn't suffer from the two issues  mentioned above with the Luna.

When I bought the Note 2, I wanted the same kind of pouch. The Krusell is by far as close as I'm going to get, and it's even better aesthetically, given the beautiful supple leather.That suppleness, while pleasing to the hand and eye, keeps it from being a five-star item, however. The case lacks the stiffness that would afford better protection (and also lacks cardboard between the leather and the inner liner that would afford much the same protection). It lays completely flat, unlike leather pocket pouches that generally retain the shape of the device.  Also, the suppleness creates an ever so slight tendency for the two halves of the upper opening to curl up.Like most good pocket pouches, it has cut outs on the top left and right to allow you to pull the device out by its sides.  However, the Note 2's sides are fairly slippery, which makes it difficult to pull out of the pouch at times. Obviously, this is not the pouch's fault, but it's something to be aware of.

Many poorly designed chargers overheat, and they can also cause the battery to overheat, which is the reason many batteries fail to properly hold a charge.Samsung designed this car charger to not activate until after the phone is attached, so you can keep the charger plugged in at all times without it getting hot.  A green light tells you when the phone is being charged.  The next \"smart\" design feature is that the charger provides a fairly rapid charge until the battery reaches about an 80% charge, and then it provides a slow \"trickle\" charge to slowly take the battery to 100%.  That prevents overheating the battery and shortening its life.However, because of that slow \"trickle\" charge feature, it is possible for the battery to actually LOSE some of its charge under high drain conditions.  For example, if you have a 95% charge, and are using 3G, GPS satellite location, and Google maps, your charge will slowly sink toward about 80%, as those features drain the battery rapidly.The battery charge is likely to stabilize in the 80% range, and will begin to go up when 3G, the GPS satellite locator, and Google Maps are turned off.  And use your task manager to make sure they are REALLY off, and not still running in the background, killing your battery).Some folks use their car charger for hours each day. A charger used 30 hours a week is going to fail a lot sooner than chargers used one or two hours a week.

I needed one of these to connect one camera to the computer because I lost the original when someone 'found' my camera case. It works.On this specific cable, everything is done right, including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and, especially, for the very good presentation on Amazon's page.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. This Amazon listing and most Cables Unlimited listings are most helpful because the Amazon page gives you a visual of what the connectors look like. Whenever in doubt, do some more research.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not BlackBerry-specific but a good cable if this is what you need", "unixReviewTime": 1258416000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2009"}

I tried it out immediately by plugging it into the USB port on my PC at my desk at work, then into my BlackBerry Style 9670.  The USB Port/PC instantly recognized the phone as a \"BlackBerry Device\" and began charging it, same as my OEM cable.  I'm not going to use it as a data sync cable, but only as a back-up charger, and it works perfectly so far.  It's a bit of a thinner gauge compared to the original OEM cable that came with my phone, but at the same time is much more flexible and pliable.  It is NOT BlackBerry branded (but wasn't expected to be based on the description), and is quite a bit shorter than described.  Amazon states 3.9 feet.  I don't have a tape measure with me, but placed side by side with the OEM cable, it's about 18 inches shorter.  No problem for me.  That actually works out better because I only need maybe 2 feet to charge my phone at work.  If you're looking for a longer cable, you might want to look into a different one though.

Coincidentially this SAMSUNG WEP 460 was on sale and seemed a bargain but buyer beware, you get what you pay for.With the Motorola Bluetooth when you open the thing to attach it to your ear the unit turns on. When you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off. This Samsung WEP460 has to be pushed to turn it on and off which is a pain in the neck to get used to and is an extra step. If you forget to shut it off after taking it off the power stays on and the battery will get drained.Worse is the fact that the charger it comes with is a standard AC adaptor for recharging inside your home. The way the packaging is, the charger is hidden inside a plastic bubble container and hidden behind black paper. You have to look very closely at the back of the packaging where an image that is 1 millimeter is shown -- look closely at that fine line drawing and that is how you will know the charger inside is AC for indoor use.We had been in the routine of using the Bluetooth when driving the car and charging it in the car and just leaving both the Bluetooth and its charger in the car all the time. We don't presently own a cigarette lighter car recharger that fits the SAMSUNG WEP460 so that would be another purchase for us (therefore raising the price of the cost of owning this unit vs the Motorola Bluetooth). Today I see the compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells for MSRP $45 which is more expensive than this SAMSUNG WEP460 Bluetooth unit itself which seems crazy!The sound quality is just fine.We regret this purchase. Next time we'll buy the Motorola Bluetooth.We also learned a lesson that the cost of these accessories is not just the accessory but the charger units.

A couple of Motorolas (which I love), an Emerson, etc. This one has great sound quality. The volume is pretty low when you first put it on, but after turning up the volume it works great. The buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable. It comes with two ear hooks, but not two different sizes. It's strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost. It also comes with several speaker covers, so that it will fit inside your ear better. It's too bad then that the ear hooks don't come in sizes. Also there are no instructions at all on replacing the hooks nor the covers.My problem is that it refuses to stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear. I tried switching all the speaker covers, but that doesn't have anything to do with the ear hook. Also, because there is no wire in the hook, you cannot bend it to fit your ear properly. That is a definite design flaw. I have tiny ears compared to the average person. This bluetooth assumes that there is a lot of space between the side of my head and the edge of my ear. That is not the case at all with my ears. This is why a curve is important for me, but there is none and no way to make one.In fact, if you look carefully for a side view of this bluetooth, you'll see that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook. It is commonly known that all should have a slant. I guess you get what you pay for. I never had this issue with my higher grade models. The ear hooks were both comfortable and reliable. This one makes my ear bleed and will not stay on. It's not how I put it on, my daughter (who works at Radio Shack) even tried to help me, but without success.If I could replace the ear hook, then it would be a top-notch bluetooth, but that is impossible so it gets a lower rating.

I have added a photo on the product page showing the 30-pin end of what I actually received.The vendor erroneously limits this product to the iPhone 3G and a gaggle of iPods, not understanding that all of the iPhones (so far) use exactly the same USB cable configuration -- if it works with one, it will work with all. USB only has 4 wires, and a USB cable's job is just to get them from one end to the other in the right order. Not a lot of room for specialization.There is no requirement for any other special pin setup on the Apple 30 pin connector for a simple USB cable. Docks can have issues, but USB is USB is USB.After a hiccup with a faulty first sample, (resolved satisfactorily by the vendor)  I now have one that works, and works perfectly with the iPhone 4.Note that the body on this 30 pin connector is rather large -- the largest I have seen. It is almost exactly twice the length of the Apple issue connector and most of the white aftermarket clones of it. I can't think of any good reason for (or advantage to) the huge connector body, and it does potentially increase the leverage on the iPhone/iPod connector.On the other hand, this cable is substantially longer than most -- at least 18\" longer than any of the other USB->iPhone cables I have. This can either be a clutter issue, or a wonderful feature.I like it.The length allows me to easily use the iPhone while it is connected to a USB charger plugged into a floor-level power strip, while the general run of cables barely make it to the chair arm.In the car, it is long enough to stash the iPhone on the dash while it is plugged into a charger port near floor level -- not possible with the shorter \"standard\" cables.So if you want a longer cable and/or one that isn't soon-to-be-grimy white, and don't want to spend a lot of bucks on it, you might want to give this one a try.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works fine on iPhone 4", "unixReviewTime": 1302307200, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2011"}

After the 1st one got ruined (within 3 months) I refused to spend another 20 bucks for another. This deal is amazing. It even looks clearer and is smoother than the Zagg shields. The price is is where this product shines.Just be sure of 2 things during application. NO DUST on surface (I used the sticky part of the 1st shield I miss used as a sticky dust magnet to prep the surface for 2nd try.. worked perfect. The other tip is make sure you lay it down perfect (not laying on edge of the chrome frame of the phone. If you do it will leave bubbles on the edge.. this is why I retried a 2nd time I was \"slightly\" off perfect and it left a lil bubble top right edge.Tip for application: Peel off layer marked \"2\" completely. Than peel only a tiny bit of layer \"1\" and get it lined up on the surface (down near home button on phone) make sure there is no bubbles. Then use a credit card to push up the phone... at the same time peel layer 1 off (same motion) If you had no dust on the surface and you are lined up perfect... you will see no bubbles and it will look flawless. Good luck!!!I use an Incase Slider case. The 1st time I didn't have the shield perfectly laid down the case made it worse and threw lots of bubbles along the edge. The 2nd time I got the shield perfect the case didn't even seem to touch it... ZERO bubbles. Its like nothing is on the phone at all.I came back here mostly to buy 2 more packs for the future. 20 times cheaper than zagg invisible shield (I feel like i saved tons of cash doing this)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Took 2 Applications but I nailed it 2nd try", "unixReviewTime": 1265587200, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2010"}

The seller is probably trying to get rid of inventory at a loss.- The size is off; it doesn't cover the glass entirely - it's too narrow and too long. When it comes to protectors, being off even a half a mm is a pain. That's why even if you know how to put these on, you're gonna go through a few to make the adjustment for wrong sizing. I went through two.- The plastic is super cheap so your fingers will not glide on it. Which means they get sticky, like if there's some kind of glue on it. That also means that you're not gonna be able to get all the bubbles out. I still have two small bubbles i can't push out from underneath.- And this is probably the biggest problem - the plastic film is so cheap that it has a rainbow effect; if you look at it from most angles, you will see the rainbow unevenness going across horizontally.

The great thing is that if you totally screw up one of them just toss it and use another. For less than $0.20 a piece you can afford to screw up a lot. I just don't get how some of these screen protectors can cost $5 a piece. Rip off!!!Air bubbles are pretty easy to deal with. A credit card works great to work those out. The worst thing is getting dust on these and I don't know what to tell you about that.

Pulling off the protective plastic when installing creates static which attracts any piece of dust within a 10 foot radius. So it's a bit of a conundrum.Regardless, these work great for me.

Ross", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I was looking for an extra cable so I can charge my iPhone 3GS from work if I forgot to charge it at home.  While searching through amazon, like you have, I came across several cables selling for $18+, and then I came across this product page and saw a picture with an odd looking cable for $1 and free shipping stating it will do the same thing as the $20 cables from Apple.  I was very skeptical and thought this was a fraud, and that most of the positive reviews must be fake or misleading.  Then I was like, \"$1 risk, why not?\"I have to state this is an amazing deal and it works.  First the picture does not look at all like what they send you.  They sent me a cable that looks exactly like the cable that comes out of the iPhone box.  It has the push buttons on the side to disconnect from the iPhone and fits a USB port perfectly.  It was shipped USPS and showed up within 5 days.  So I have no idea how these people are making a profit off selling these cables unless they are selling in major bulk.Not only is the product great, but I also have to give kudos to the seller.  I received my product in the mail, then the next day I got an email from the seller stating they had a fire in their warehouse and lost data on 2000 orders, so they have no idea if product was shipped on any of those orders and if I did not get it, to email them back and they will ship me another cable on just my word.  They were more concerned about their seller rating on amazon than ensuring that people did not get extra cables.  Most companies I've dealt with would wait for me to complain and then say, \"Oh, we had a fire and we could not tell who it affected.  We'll take care of it now that you have complained.\"Great cable, great seller.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Deal and it works great", "unixReviewTime": 1292889600, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2010"}

At that price it is a good bargain for anyone who wants a plain vanilla headset with decent sound quality. I find that the sound itself is excellent--far superior to any other bluetooth headset I've used. The device is simple and thus easy to use, and the design is a notch better than most of the devices out there. As for fit, the device sits in your ear rather than over it, though there is an optional ear loop. I find that it nestles comfortably in my ear so that I don't notice it's there. The downsides are that because it's not a current model there are a number of things it can't do, and in addition I find that the range is not that great--sound degrades rapidly once the earpiece is not in a direct line with the phone or other device.The device has one multicolored LED which is difficult to see if you are not looking directly at it.

My chief complaints:1) the little rubber ear pieces that are supposed to hold it in your ear make for a good fit. BUT they incessantly break, forcing you to buy and replace them constantly.2) it is supposed to offer simplified use with only 2 buttons. BUT it requires you to figure out which combination of buttons to press, how long to hold it, when to let go and what to do next. It makes it surprisingly difficult to use. For example, I want to pair it with the phone but end up turning it off instead. (Does anyone else have this problem or am I just incompetent?)3) minor annoyance, but often times, it is difficult to tell if it is on or off. So often times, I think its off and I try to turn it on, just to find out that I just turned it off. The different colors on the light are supposed to indicate its current on/off state, but I just never seem to have good luck with it. (Again, may be it is just my incompetence?)However, there are some nice aspects: it looks sleek and is compact, fitting nicely in the ear. Battery life seems to be ok as well. I never found much use for the dual microphone noise reduction capability. People on the phone always told me that they could hear no difference when I used it.As a result of the challenges I found with it, I rarely find myself using it anymore. So the long and the short of it is that I am not very satisfied, certainly not at the price. My personal opinion is that it does not offer good value, considering how much you are forking out on it.I used the Plantronics Voyager 510 before and was quite satisfied with it before I lost it.
