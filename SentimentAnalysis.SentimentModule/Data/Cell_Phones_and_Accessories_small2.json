I read...and researched...and got a headache!  I have been impressed w/ Grantwood Technology in the past for other things, so I felt fairly confident in ordering this.  I already have my iPhone in a case (ifrogz) which is a slim case, but I need something to attach to my waistband when I'm on the go (I don't like carrying things in my pocket and I certainly don't walk around my office carrying my purse)!  :)The leather is grainy in appearance and the stitching is a nice added touch = definitely gender neutral.  I love the magnetic closure flap = very secure.  The clip on the back is substantial = again, very secure.What I am MOST pleased about (because I was worried about it), not only does this fit my Verizon iPhone 4 perfectly, it even fits w/ my ifrogz case on it (its a bit tight and the fit is really ideal w/out the case, but I hate fiddling w/ taking off/putting on, so I will take the tighter fit w/ my case on any day of the week).  This means (in case I wasn't clear) that when I'm going to be in a meeting or away from my desk, I can just slip my iPhone (case and all) into this holster and go - WHOOT!  For any case thicker than mine or a bling case, you will probably have to remove prior to sliding into this holster.  The holster doesn't dislodge the plug/cover I have in the charging slot on the bottom of my phone.  Also, while I can attach my stylus to the phone in this holster, I do have to remove it every time I put my phone into or take it out of this holster = but that is not a big deal to me at all.Grantwood Technology as a seller is fabulous = great communication when needed, prompt service/shipping - I am most pleased w/ this seller and this product!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WONDERFUL item", "unixReviewTime": 1302652800, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2011"}

The plastic belt clip has a ratcheted pivot and the end of it is molded to securely attach to a belt.  The case remains horizontal, rides close to your side, and the magnetic cover flap stays put, yet easily lifts out of the way.  Grantwood Technology did a great job designing this case.This holster is exactly what I was looking for. If there's anything negative about it, I haven't found it.  Five stars all the way!07/15/2012, UpdateAfter the third plastic belt clip snapped off my Quick Flip Case, Grantwood Technology was nice enough to replace it with a more durable case sporting a metal clip.  Grantwood said this replacement is an older version, but I like it just as much as the Quick Flip Case.  The only real difference I can see is that the clip doesn't swivel, so the case stays in the horizontal position.  Since this is my preferred carry position, this doesn't present a problem for me.I do want to add that Grantwood Technology has been wonderful to deal with.  They stand behing their products 100-percent, and their customer service is top notch ... Five stars all the way.06/20/2012, UpdateThe bad news:I'm now on my third Quick Flip Case.  The plastic belt clip hinge broke off the first case; and the plastic belt clip assembly seperated from the back of the second replacement case.The good news:1) Grantwood Technology is excellent to do business with; they stand behind their products and guarantees completely.  Grantwood immediately shipped no-cost replacements to me without requiring the return of the defective cases.2) Before doing so they gave me the option of a full refund, a replacement, or an upgrade. I like this case so much, I chose the replacement over the refund.3) Grantwood Technology had the manufacturer correct the problem on the newest release of this case, so the clip assembly shouldn't seperate from the case again.Although I took one star away from the original five star rating, I still really like this case.  And, if this one should become defective, I know Grantwood Technology will continue to do the right thing and offer a full refund.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Holster for the iPhone 4S", "unixReviewTime": 1330473600, "reviewTime": "02 29, 2012"}

First, to answer a question I had before I bought it: Yes, it will hold an iPhone 3G that's inside a Griffin Clarifi case and likely other cases of similar bulk.I like that it's a magnetic closure; no \"rip\" of Velcro when I try to sneak it out of the holster during a meeting.It holds the iPhone snugly, perhaps a little too snuggly at the moment, but as the leather relaxes over time I prefer it to be a little tight to begin with.I prefer the horizontal holster as it's low profile and stays out of the way. The belt hook is reinforced with metal at the end so it won't fray and get in the way as you try to get it on your belt over time. It's just a very nice, relatively low cost holster.UPDATE 6/7/09: This was a very nice holster, but I find the seams starting to rip already on the end straps.

I own an incase slider, griffin elan form and a snap on case (brand name forgotten). All are good cases with the incase taking top honors esthetically. The problem with all three is that shock protection is less than than adequate in my opinion. I haven't had to test their shock protection fortunately but all three are hard plastic cases. They will more than adequately protect from scratches but I have my doubts about their ability to protect from a drop onto tile or concrete. Which brings me to the case-mate vroom. I bought it for the novelty of the tread design but it has become my daily case for several reasons. Without being overly  bulky (ie. otterbox), it has enough soft silicone material to almost guarantee a safe landing onto a hard surface. The fit isn't as tight as I would like but it has proven to me that it stays put. For example, when I squeeze this into and out of my leather holster (DLO), it feels like the case may not be strong enough to stand up to this day in and day out. Yet every time I remove it from the holster, the camera lens is centered perfectly in the vroom's camera port. This is a pretty good indication that the case isn't stretching and that it stays in place. Another nice feature is the material's ability to stay put if left on a car seat. The the silicone has just enough friction to keep it in place in a moving car on cloth car seats. I haven't tried it on leather or vinyl. Lastly, the price is great. The incase and others are 2-3 times more expensive.

It is durable and provides very good protection for your iPhone without making it overly bulky like most \"armor\" cell phone cases do.I would suggest that once you get it, before you start messing with it, go to manufacturer's web site ([...]) and find this item, then clik VIDEO. This will play a YouTube video explaining how to take the case apart, install the iPhone, and put it all back together.Also, make sure to completely clean the screen of the iPhone, the inside of the screen protector of the case, and the external surfaces of the iPhone. With any luck you will never need to remove the iPhone again. I used a microfiber cloth intended to clean eyeglasses and it worked perfectly.I say 'almost perfect' in the title of this case because while using the belt clip as a desktop prop to landscape viewing (explained in the above-mentioned video) you can not connect the charging/sync cable. This is a small bummer, but not a big deal. If it were possible to give a rating of 4.9 stars I would have.Update: My current opinion after three months....Belt holster: Not very good. The phone comes out of it too easy as others have said.  I simply carry thing thing in my pocket.The case itself: I can't imagine carrying around my iPhone without it. It's been dropped to hard surfaces a number of times and the phone is still perfect.  The screen and the 'oil slick' problem: I figured the screen protector would get scratched up and whatnot eventually. So what I did was remove the iPhone from the case, then I puched on the screen protector from the front inward until it popped out. Then I took an exacto knife and scraped off the remaining glue residue from where the screen portector was glued in place. Then I bought a $10 kit of three adhesive screen protectors. these come in regular, anti-glare, privacy, etc. take your pick. Put the adhesive screen portector on the iPhone (after carefully cleaning the screen) then put the iPhone back in the case.  Using this method, if the screen protector gets crummy looking, you can always take the whole thing apart and put a new protector on.  I just did this screen protector replacement after three months constant use. The case was full of dust and lint, which cleaned-up well enough.  Once I wiped all the dust off the iPhone itself, it looked like it was brand freakin new.

However, after you purchase your case, go to an Apple Store and purchase an, \"anti-glare film set for iphone  3G/3GS\" screen protector.  The key is \"anti-glare\"! Ask them to put it on your phone.  The young man took the phone out of the case, sprayed a cleaner on the screen and the otterbox screen.  I still saw the mark so he cleaned it again.  The cloth he used appeared to be the problem so I let him use the cloth that came with my sunglasses and that worked leaving no marks/air bubbles on the screen.  The screen is beautiful.  Do not get confused with the regular screen protectors for the iPhone because we had that on the phone prior to the anti-glare and it did not work because the mark was still on the phone.To sum it up, you will have two screen protectors on your phone, the anti-glare protector as well as the one that is on the otterbox.Model number of sorts is PIA-06E which may be the number for the original iphone as well as the 3g/3gs phone. If you have a 3g or 3gs iphone, make sure the front of the screen protector package reads, 3g/3gs because if you buy it without that specification on the front, then you will probably be buying the screen protector for the original iphone and that protector does not completely cover the 3g phones.You get two protectors that cover the 3gs phone well for 14.95.  It is made by power support.  It is sold on Amazon but as I stated I had great success with the Apple employee making the application.The belt clip/case that comes with the otterbox:In order for the phone to stay in the case, you MUST place the phone in the holder with the screen facing your body and the BACK of the phone facing away from the body.  If I were approaching you, I should be able to see the apple on the back of the phone and not the screen of your phone.  If you do so, there is not a problem with the case and the phone as well as the safety of the phone.Sound:We do not have any problems with hearing the phone ring or any of the sounds that the phone makes.Water protection:I was told from the employee at the apple store that if the phone encased with the otterbox drops in water, if the phone is recovered within 3 seconds, then the odds is that the phone will be okay.  That is, if you have all the openings closed on the phone.  Therefore, it is imperative that the cover openings remain closed on the case at all times.Iphone warranty:If you purchased the extended warranty the warranty extended or not will not cover the phone if the phone is dropped in water, if the screen breaks or if the screen is in a bunch of pieces.  Therefore, purchasing the otterbox is a no brainer!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solution to RID water mark/Oil Slick look!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1253923200, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2009"}

First, the good things: it offers excellent protection from drops, scrapes and the occasional rain storm. When your phone is clipped face-in on the belt clip it's pretty much impervious to most shock and any kind of screen damage.About the only thing it won't protect against is getting dropped in a body of water. It's water resistant, but NOT waterproof. Most of the phone is covered by plastic or silicone except for two holes on the bottom for the speakers, and a cloth cover over the part where you put your ear. I've had my iPhone in the Defender for about 3 months and it looks as shiny as the day I bought it.A few caveats: the plastic film that covers the screen has a weird oily \"pooling\" effect that's distracting. I've found that a light dusting of corn starch on the side that contacts the iPhone will get rid of it for a while.The silicone outer casing picks up dirt and lint like nobody's business. I have to wipe it down with a damp cloth several times a week or it's a phone-sized fuzzball. A minute in a blue jeans pocket will coat the thing.

These fit a 3.5 mm jack, NOT the old 2.5 mm that you would find in most other/older phones.  Easy way to test if you're not sure, take an iPod headset (or any headset you use for a mp3 or CD player), and see if it fits.  If it does, than you are looking at the right headset.Before getting into too much detail let me first give a concise Pro/Con summation:Pro:Best earbuds on any headphones I've ever used.Con:The microphone is as equally bad as the earbuds are good.Despite being slightly shocked by just how good the earbuds were, these are of no use to me if the microphone is unusable.The Sennheiser MM50 iP Earbuds / Headset have the most outstanding sound I've ever hear from a headset, but an incredibly BAD microphone.  Also, the Sennheisers were engineered to keep the microphone close to your mouth by placing it at the Y of the headphone split, and making on line short enough to pull the mic close to your mouth.  This is an awful design that should never be repeated.  I found myself constantly having to repeat myself when talking on this headset.I can say though, that with the Sennheiser Earbuds, I could hear details in my music that I never heard before.  A simply amazing sound, with outstanding isolation capabilities.  In a very noisy gym, I could keep my iPhone at a low volume and still hear great detail to my music.In comparison, the Ultimate Ears MetroFi headset keeps the normal, symmetrical Y shape to the earbuds, and places the microphone on one of the lines, close to your mouth.  Having my wife call me on her Chocolate 3 phone, I was at first disappointed. \"Did you forget to bring the headset with you?\" I asked.  Nope, she had them on.Over the years, between the two of us, we've probably used about a dozen different headsets between the two of us, and the MetroFi set was the clear winner when it came to microphone quality.  Funny thing is, to look at them, you wouldn't think it.For earbud quality test, I compared them to my Sony, J2, Metrofi 170vi, and iPod earbuds (all noise isolating except the iPod).  Sound quality places the MetroFi 170vi down by the iPod headset, and sadly, they were probably equal to the iPod headset for noise isolation as well.  The Sony and J2 earbuds were roughly equal in both categories, far behind the Sennheiser, and slightly less far ahead of the MetroFi 170vi and iPod set.Comfort wise, I would rate the four as follows: Sennheiser (again, by far), MetroFi 170vi, Sony, then J2 (So bad, they caused one of my ears to be sore for days)Durability could probably be a little better, but they haven't failed me yet.  So far, just one of the 1 1/2 inch sleaves, attached to the earbuds has come off.I would recommend the Metrofi 170vi set over these.  IMHO, when wearing headphones that are also a headset, microphone quality trumps headset quality.edit 11/28/2010I earbud died shortly after this review. It kills me, 'cause for comfort and sound quality, nothing beats these... nothing even comes close to these.

You'll find it's flexibility remarkable. Once you've found that sweet spot, press the suction cup FIRMLY against the surface...while...AT SAME TIME, turning that \"ribbed knob\" (you turned left before), firmly to the RIGHT - all the way - until the suction cup is firmly locked in place. That's it! Turning the knob pushes down on the suction-cup, forcing air out, and locking mount in place.The mount is so flexible is design, it really can mount almost anywhere, and the spring-loaded arms open wide...enough to hold my Samsung Note2 firmly in place.The only frustration I found is the moveable arm will be \"slightly\" pull from a dead-on straight view...simply by the phone's weight. But playing with angles & locations will almost assure a spot you'll be happy with.Company very wisely included a plate to replace the suction cup which has a very strong adhesive on back. This allows placement virtually anywhere you want.Compact, solid, and does the job fore a small investment (right here on Amazon).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great!

{"reviewerID": "ADLVFFE4VBT8", "asin": "B001GD87QO", "reviewerName": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Jabra's EXTREME Bluetooth headset turns out to be a solid product and it has what it takes to, possibly, stand out in the crowded and fiercely competitive field of Bluetooth headsets. I will start by discussing the features that appeal to me the most with the most important at the top of the list:- Extremely light weight - quite impressively so, especially coming from a company known for making those 'office' half-foot long boom microphones sticking out of one's ears. I had the EXTREME in my ear for more than an hour at a time and I could hardly feel it.- Can stay connected to 2 devices simultaneously - most helpful because when working I use both my 'regular' phone and MS Communicator (company standard) running on my laptop so, after pairing them both to the EXTREME, it's a lot easier for me to communicate.- Can pair with up to 8 devices - nice, but I have no idea what happens when you try to pair the 9th. I have mine paired to 5 at this time and all is well. If I ever go beyond 8 and live, I will come back to this review and update it with my experience.- Many charging options - the headset's Micro-B socket can get power from the supplied AC-to-USB adapter (cord is only 1 ft. long), through the car-to-USB adapter, from one of your own computer's powered USB slots or from anything that comes with a Micro-B plug such as some other headset's charger.- Multiple wear styles - you get 2 'behind the ear' hooks (large and small), 2 'inside ear' hooks attached to their own gels. There's no problem to use it in either right or left ear.- Good in and out sound quality. I tested it with friends and co-workers who either didn't notice a difference between this set and the device I used before or, in a couple of occasions, volunteered to tell me that the connection was a lot clearer than in used to be.- Controls as ergonomically placed as possible on such a small headset. Both the answer/end and the 2 volume (+-) buttons are easy to reach. The on/off switch is not but you don't need and in fact you don't want to touch that while wearing the set. You can redial by double-tapping answer/end, you answer by tapping it once and you may reject the call by keeping it pressed for 2-3 seconds. Voice dialing (not one of my favorite options when in office) is also supported.- Nice presentation - the headset comes inside an nice clear plastic case that makes it really stand out and look like some modern art museum display and could be a storage option when not in use.- Excellent customer support. Again, a surprise. I was talking to a real human person within a couple of minutes of calling Jabra's support line when I thought I had a problem with either charging or pairing (false alarm, my fault). The support technician helped me to quickly solve the problem and, while at that, told me that I could send my defective unit back for a replacement if the product turned out to be defective, which it wasn't.- 1 year limited warranty - whatever. If it breaks and it's not your fault you may get a free replacement, probably a refurbished unit.There are a couple of things where improvement is possible and the one that stands out is the pairing PIN code, always '0000'. This is something that's easy to remember but it's also a safety concern. If my device is lost or stolen I do not want it to be easily usable by someone else - a unique code would make the headset less attractive. I also didn't like the way the accessories, unlike the headset piece itself, come crowded inside a little cardboard box. You only use one gel/hook at a time and those not in use are small and delicate little items. It would have been nice if Jabra threw in a little pouch or some more permanent box with the package to store the unused accessories.Here are some more specs and features, as claimed by the vendor:- Noise Blackout feature reduces as much as 24dB of background noise - this is possible, Jabra says, because the EXTREME comes with dual microphones- Adjusts volume automatically so you ears won't get hurt- Provides audio shock protection (see above)- Up to 5.5 hrs of talk time between charges- Up to 10.5 days standby timePackage contents:- Headset- 2 gels- 2 ear hooks (small and large)- 2 'inside ear' hooks- Car charger adapter- USB charger adapter (will use with the car charger or plug it into your computer)- AC charger- ManualI am very happy with this EXTREME set so far. It's comfortable to wear, easy to charge and it gives me good quality sound in and out which is 90% of what a headset is about. That with the few extra features make for a good product. The lack of storage for the small accessories bothers me but not to the degree where I would take away one star so, since this is likely to be one of my favorite headsets, the EXTREME gets the 5-star treatment.__________________________March 15 Note:After one month or so, the EXTREME has become my main headset now. I like it so much, I've ordered a second to keep in the office where I frequently switch between VoIP Microsoft Communicator calls via my laptop and Blackberry and the EXTREME can handle them both with ease. I've settled for the 'inside the ear' hook because it's so easy to take it in and out.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Life Is EXTREMELY Good - oh... wait, this is a Jabra", "unixReviewTime": 1267056000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2010"}

Hudson \"bisou bisou\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I have had this for a few months now and wanted to use it with several phones before placing my review. It was used on the Verizon network on a LG phone and also on the Sprint network on the EVO phone.At first I must admit I thought the Bluetooth was too small. However, it proved that what you see is not what you get. First, the fit is hands down the most comfortable I have tried. It has several ear pieces and also the over the ear hooks to choose from. I did not have to try many; I was able to select the perfect ones just by looking at them. The fact that everything is included is great! I love how you can charge this headset in the car, at the computer, or in the wall.When talking on it I was told people could hear me fine. One friend commented that compared to my other sets this one picked up my voice and somehow was able to block out the other background noise. I tested this on walks and also in a noisy spa I go to and compared to the other headsets I have this was the best. I was told that this headset was the clearest and again would block out other unwanted sounds.I have used it to stream music with Pandora on the EVO with the A2DP. I love that I can listen to music on walks or in the grocery store line. I also listen to a lot of pod cast on it. As far as battery life I have not had any issues. I charge the headset every night so it is always fully charged and ready to go.My only con would be that sometimes it sets itself to a setting that I am not aware on. Meaning, I will be asked if I am using the \"good\" Bluetooth and when I say \"Yes\" I am told, \"Wow, it sounded so much better earlier or yesterday\". I found that turning the Bluetooth on and off somehow resets it and the person can hear my voice loud and clear again without the other background noise. Why it needs to be reset, I am not sure. For that I deduct one star.I will say I have never owned a Jabra product before but after using this headset I will not hesitate to try their other electronic products.

I'm not exactly easy to please as far as tech is concerned, in fact, this is probably the 4th headset I've bought and it's the only one I haven't returned.First off, the form factor is GREAT. Really, this thing is really small and strikes the delicate balance between modern and pompous. You definitely won't look like one of the prats with a surfboard hanging off their year. Also worth noting is the PHYSICAL on-off switch. After dealing with so many \"hold for X seconds to power on\" headsets, the on-off switch is a no-hassle god-send. The volume keys are a bit small for my taste, but my phone (Palm Pre) actually integrated well with the headset and the volume keys on the phone replicated the function of the volume keys on the headset.In terms of call quality, it was good. But the \"dual microphone\" setup they tout here isn't of much benefit to the person you're talking to. That is, if you're in a loud environment, the person on the other end of the phone won't be able to hear you. The dual-mics also do nothing for windy environments. That said, the incoming voice quality was always superb and I could hear everything, even in noisy environments. In terms of pairing/connection, I've had a couple issues where I had to connect/reconnect but it's not enough to make me go out and get a new headset. The issues were generally fixed quite quickly and I'm not sure that it wasn't actually my phone's fault.In terms of fit, the proper combo for me was the earloop + standard earpiece (essentially, the way it comes out of the box). I promise you, the earpiece is going to HURT for a few days. Wait for the rubber to soften and your ear to adapt a bit and things will get better. I'm pretty happy with the comfort and fit now.The headset comes with an impressive array of charging accessories. Including wall charger, USB charger and car charger. The design of the USB charger is especially well thought out, it's a small, cordless, L-shaped charger that works wonderfully. When coupled with the car charger, you have a hassle-free on-the-go charging solutionFinally, as others have mentioned the packaging here is downright wasteful. No one needs a hard plastic display case for their ear piece. Turn it down, Jabra...we aren't impressed.Overall, I really like the product. The worst part is the packaging and a few connection problems.

The call quality is great, controls are convenient to use, it is small, light and comfortable, and it uses a standard micro-USB charging connector.I appreciate very much that it comes with an ear hook.  In my opinion, an ear hook provides extra protection against loosing the headset and helps me to avoid pain and discomfort from the pressure that in-the-ear gels would cause.Pros:* The call quality is great.  Callers sound very slightly muffled, but it was not a problem for me.  The volume goes up sufficiently for use in the car. As a matter of fact, I do not turn the volume all the way up.  The people on the other end could hear me very well.* The controls are very intuitive.  I really like the dedicated >>sliding&lt;&lt; on/off switch.  The headset connects to my BB 8900 or to my wife's BB 8310 very quickly.  The middle multi-function button (call answer/end, voice dialing activation, redial) is very easy to use.  To activate voice dialing the multi-function button requires just one push.  I do not have to press and hold it like on other bluetooth headsets I tried (several Nokias, Blackberry 655+, Discovery 975, Jabra STONE).* For me Jabra EXTREME is very comfortable.  It is light, so soon after putting it on my ear I stop being aware of it hanging there.  It does not create any pressure points in my ear, so no pain that I usually get after wearing Plantronics Discovery 975 for a while.* Micro-USB charging connector.  I usually charge my portables at home on my nightstand, but, occasionally, I need to charge a phone or a headset in my car.  I prefer headsets like this one that I can plug my car charger into and that do not require any charging pods like Jabra STONE or Blackberry 655+, because if the headset battery dies when I am driving I you loose the hands-free option.Cons* Very short charging cord. The AC charging cord that came with the headset is about 1 foot long. I charge my portables on top of my nightstand and the power strip is located under the night stand and all cords are routed behind the nightstand. I would not be able to use the original Jabra charger with this setup. Thankfully, Jabra uses the same micro-USB connector as my BB 8900, so I was able use the charger I already have.Overall, I like Jabra EXTREME very much and I hope that it lasts for a long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great overall headset", "unixReviewTime": 1266883200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2010"}

That was until I gotUltimate Ears MetroFi 170vi Noise Isolating Earphones w/ Microphone.I had a few issues with UE:  1. Price.  Considering all of the pro's and con's for that particular set, I didn't (and still, don't) feel that it is a good value for what it offers, despite it's comfortable feel.  2. Sound quality.  The UE wasn't wholly superior to the stock Blackberry headset or the even less expensive Coby knockoff.  Both of which were less than half the price and the Blackberry had a better sound quality with certain kinds of music.  And, Construction.

First thing, it is extremely comfortable and form-fitting.  The first night I received them I went out for a walk and kept them on for the next five (5) hours.  Conversations with a T-Mobile representative inside a Walgreens, a business conversation outside with heavy traffic going by and listening to music or spoken word on some steps adjacent to my apartment all resulted in the same thing: crystal clear reception.

I plugged it into the car charger, which is designed wonderfully, and it was fully charged in about 20 minutes.  I turned it on, put it in my ear, and turned on the bluetooth in my IPOD touch.  it paired by itself in about 15 seconds.  5 seconds after that my Stern podcast was coming into the headset.  I'm a utility line tech, and love this thing even just for this functionaliy.  No more wires while I work!A few minutes after pairing my IPOD I paired it up with my phone.  This was a little harder - I had to hold down the answer button on the headset for 5 seconds, the light turned blue on the extreme, and I put my phone into discovery mode.  It paired, again almost by itself, in about 20 seconds.  The sound quality is great.  This is the third headsed I've owned.  A motorola H710 which i loved until I ran it through the wash machine and a motorola h15 that I threw out the window when it was completely unhearable in an environment with ANY noise.  The Extreme is Loud!  I drive for a living from job to job.  Its loud enough for me to hear even while standing behind my truck in a road with traffic going by.  The 710 was just as loud, but its been phased out and does not support a2dp, so no music.In short, if you have an IPOD or smart phone and want to listen to both calls and music in a loud environment, this is the headset!!This is also the first headset with a power switch - when I turn it on it pairs with both my IPOD and my phone (a motorola from Verizon, not a smart phone, just a phone) in about 5 seconds.  Its fast enough to leave it off and turn it on when the phone rings.

The front of the headset contains the answer/end button, volume buttons, and indicator light.  The only other control is a toggle power switch on the bottom of the unit.  The answer/end button can be tapped twice to perform a redial or held down briefly to reject a call.  The headset is of the stubby variety and does not have a boom mike; rather two microphones are behind the mesh on the front of the unit.  Lastly, the headset has more of a masculine look to it, with its dark and blocky design.Sound quality was good on my end and the callers said they could hear me clearly.  I tested the noise cancellation in a very loud room (with a blasting stereo), and though I was speaking at a normal volume, the caller said they could hear me well.  Wind resistance is OK, it works well in a moderately windy situation, but when the wind picks up the callers have a more difficult time hearing.  To really test wind resistance, I used the Jabra about 1 foot from a room fan on medium and the caller said she could barely hear me.  I then switched to thePlantronics Discovery 975 Bluetooth Headsetthat I also have, and the caller said she could hear me clearly, and that it was a marked difference.  Granted this is an extreme situation, but it's something you should keep in mind if you're typically using your headset in a windy environment.  I'd equate the wind I was getting from the fan at that speed and distance to be what I usually experience when I am at the beach.  So it's not something most people will experience everyday, but if frequent this type of environment, you should be aware of it.The Jabra hooked up easily, and worked well, with my iPhone 3Gs, Nokia N96, and MacBook.  Battery life is rated at 5.5 hours and seems right to me.  It charges quickly in 2 hours and the indicator light on the front changes from red > yellow > green to indicate charge progress.The Jabra's accessories are comprehensive; and include a 12V car charger, a swivel USB computer charger (see my included photos), an AC charger, two different sized ear gels and an extra ear hook.It fits my ear well, and I appreciate the over the ear hook, which is both discreet and makes the headset feel securely inserted.  The headset is light, the buttons are easy to push, and while I can \"feel\" the headset when I initially put it on, I forget I am wearing it shortly after (I should mention that I do not wear my headset all day, only when I am making calls, which is for about an hour at a time).All in all... a nicely designed and stylish headset, not the best for extremely windy environments though.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A stylish and well-sorted headset, that falls short for wind-noise resistance.", "unixReviewTime": 1268611200, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2010"}

Christensen \"Frequent traveler, business o...", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "Over the years I have owned no less than 10 bluetooth headsets, and they have all eventually had critical flaws.  I have a strangely shaped ear, and even when I find a headset that works beautifully, too often it simply doesn't fit my ear properly (previous Jabra \"over the ear\" style headsets, for example).  TheJabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headsetis so far the best headset that I have used.  Other previous headsets includePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset, andPlantronics Pulsar 590A Headset,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset, as well as headsets from Apple and previous over-the-ear units from Jabra like theJABRA BT2020.Here's how I'd score the Jabra EXTREMEFit & Finish5/5 stars.  Even the packaging is impressive.  I expected to hear angels sing in the background when I popped open the packaging (not quite like opening an Apple product, but close).  The headset is encased in a plastic \"display stand\" with all of the documentation and charging accessories included below the charging stand.  The quality of all the components appears to be top-notch, with no obvious plastic seams or burrs, no weird molding aberrations, and nice smooth, shiny surfaces.  The buttons function smoothly, but with enough feedback to let you know they have been activated (MUCH better than the Plantronics units I have used in the past).  This unit ranks right up there with the Apple BT headset in terms of fit & finish.Size/Weight5/5/ stars.  The lightest most comfortable headset I have used which actually functions well (I have used other that feel more comfortable, but their performance was unacceptable.  This unit is tiny and very light weight.  Placing it in your ear (without the ear hook) it it is able to \"suspend\" itself in position because it is so light weight.\"Wearability\" - comfort4.5/5 stars.  The included \"behind the ear\" hooks are typically very popular, but I find them uncomfortable. This is why I have historically preferred larger \"over the ear\" type headsets like thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] or thePlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset.  However, this headset comes with the option of a tiny rubber hooked insert that fits inside the folds of your ear.  I was skeptical at first, but because of the light weight of the unit, it works extremely well.  I find that I can walk around, bend down, lean over, and even jog without the unit dislodging from my ear.  Because the hooked ear gel is so soft, it is a universal fit, and I would imagine it will fit even hard-to-fit ears (like mine).Performance/sound quality4/5 stars.  I'm still not convinced that this is the *best* headset for sound quality (I think the Voyager Pro may be better) but the iPhone is notoriously lousy with respect to Bluetooth in general, so it may be more of an issue with my phone while I've been testing this headset than the headset itself.  For what it's worth, my Voyager Pro lasted about a year before it suddenly dropped to about 1/3 volume (permanently), making it unusable.Battery Life/Talk time5/5 stars.  As good as any other headset I have used in terms of standby and talk time.  After a week of daily use (several hours of calls per day) I have yet had the battery go dead on my.  I just charge it when I think about it, which has been every couple of days.  Some other headsets (like the Voyager Pro) actually say in your ear \"battery is low\"; I don't know if this one does, because it has not gotten low enough yet!  I will update this review once I run the battery all the way down.Charging options5/5 stars.  This is an area where the Jabra EXTREME really shines!  First of all, there is a STANDARD micro-USB port for charging, so no proprietary charger is needed! (are you other headset mfg's listening?!!) Included in the box is a wonderful array of charging options.  First, you have the standard wall charger which will be very similar to those you might already use for other devices such as newer Blackberry's etc.  Next, you have a really nifty little USB dongle that has a ratcheting joint, allowing it to be positioned out of the way when plugged into a USB port on your laptop (see my pictures of it plugged into my Macbook Pro).  This USB dongle converts regular USB to the micro-USB, so it can be used with ANY powersource that outputs power to a USB outlet (e.g. power inverter in your car, wall chargers, computers, etc.).  Normally you would have to pay $10 to $20 for this type of dongle, particularly one this quality.  Finally, there is even a 12v cigarette lighter plug included!  This plug has a USB output on the back, so you can use it in conjunction with the dongle to charge your headset in your car or boat.  What I love about the charging accessories, is that ALL THREE components are universal and can be used with any other Micro-USB device and interchanged with any other Micro-USB stuff.  I love it when I can consolidate the junk I have to carry on trips!Nicely done, Jabra!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best headset yet - light, comfortable, good sound quality", "unixReviewTime": 1267056000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2010"}

I have an older Logitec Mobile Freedom which was fairly inexpensive yet works great.  I also have a Plantronics Voyager Pro.  My requirements are the basics: good sound quality, simple use, comfort, and cutting down wind/background noise.At a little over $50, the Jabra Extreme falls right in between the aforementioned Logitec and Plantronics products (about $30 and $75, respectively).While I really like both of the other products, the Jabra would be my preference.  It cancels background noise out somewhat better than the Logitec and at least as well as the more expensive Plantronics Voyager Pro. I found it had great sound quality on both ends, and there was no background noise at all.  I tested this in my car with the window down at highway speeds, at a soccer game, and in a crowded pub.  Now, please keep in mind, YOU will still hear all that noise as you are there in person, but the person on the other end of your call will have a very easy time hearing you.  And you can hear them fine in noisy situation.What's in the box?  Quite a bit actually!  Usually, with this type of product you get the headset, a charger and maybe a spare earpeice cover.  Jabra gives you:* The Jabra Extreme headset* One spare ear rest* Two spare earpiece covers* * AC Charger* Car charger adapter* USB to min-USB connector* User GuideSetup of the Jabra is what you'd expect.  It charges quickly, usable within a half hour or so and fully charged in about 2 hours.  Displays are simple.  Green is fully charged, yellow 70% or more, and red less than 70% charged.  The charge holds nicely.  I used about 4 hours of talk time in a 12 hour period and still left the device on all night and it was fine the next morning, and I used it for another hour the next day.The unit is small, smaller than many others, which is nice.  I love my Plantronics but its a pretty big product.  The Extreme is very comfortable and lightweight.Controls are simple to use.  Slide the on/off button to 'on'.  Green light means it is on, and it will flash blue when connected.  Again, very simple and somewhat typical of a headset.To answer a call, press the Answer/End button.

No issues pairing and functioning.Now, lots of headsets have similar features.  Here are the three things I love about the Extreme.  One, it's very convenient, since it is extremely lightweight, small, and comfortable.  The other is the inclusion of the car charger in the box. With some headsets you get just an AC charger.  The Extreme includes both.  So, in your car, plug in the charger, plug the USB connector into that, and the headset sits right on it, very neat and simple.If you go to the Jabra website you will see what I'm talking about as far as its car connection.

I want to give it 5 stars, except for one fatal flaw...  Read on.FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe packaging was elegant and the headset immediately fit my ear perfectly with the earpiece that comes with it.  It comes with other earpieces, including two sizes of ear hooks.  Pairing it with my iPhone was quick and easy.  The on/off switch is terrific; with myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] you don't know if it is on or off, you need to just hold in the power button to find out.  The speed at which it connects when turning it on is incredible!  The talk button is easy to find with the finger and use, along with the volume buttons.  I wear the headset on my left ear, so I have to remember that up volume is the bottom button and vice versa, but that's no problem.It comes with a cigarette lighter adapter to a USB port, which is great for any USB charging and an AC adapter.LISTENINGI found the audio quality to be decent and it got fairly loud, although at highway speeds or in a crowd, it can be hard to get it loud enough without smashing it into my ear canal.I would shocked to find that it plays my music, podcast, audiobooks and most any other audio from the iPhone (called A2DP).  HOW GREAT!!  This is the greatest feature of this headset.  You can be listening to an audiobook while no one notices!  Other headsets in its class are just starting to add this.TALKINGAt first people didn't complain about being able to hear me, but upon talking to my doctor, he said he could hardly hear me because I sounded like I was in a tunnel.  This started happening more and more.  I tried turning off/on the headset, phone; re-pairing, but nothing seems to have a lasting effect.  I don't know if this is related to the iPhone itself, or if a firmware update could help (I haven't found any available firmware updates as of May 2010).If someone couldn't hear me, I would switch over to my Plantronics Voyager 510 and they would tell me how much better they could hear me.I called Jabra support for advice, and the gentlemen recommended resetting the headset and then re-pairing to the phone.  Here are the instructions from the Jabra website:\"It is possible to reset and test the headset by 'pressing and holding' all three buttons at the same time. The red, blue and green light will light up in a white light. In this mode, the pairing list is reset, and you can test if the headset works as you will be able to hear audio in the speaker from the microphone.  The headset will automatically turn off after approx. 10 seconds. The next time you power on, the headset will go into pairing mode as the first time you powered your new EXTREME on.\"While callers could hear me for the first call or two, after that, it returned to unusable.  This is making me carry two bluetooth headsets; one for audio, one for calls...FITIt fits very well, although it has fallen out sometimes with bending over or chewing. By adding the ear loop, it has a great fit.  Everyone's ears are different, so you'll just have to try...BATTERY LIFEI was surprised that I could get a whole day of calls and listening to audio with a device so small!  I have been charging each night.  The standard micro-USB-B connector is fantastic for charging.  I'm so thankful that we're getting away from a unique charger for every piece of electronics.  I bought some micro-USB cables for cheap and can charge at home, car or office now.SIZEI love how small it is, so that it looks discreet, but I am so afraid that I will lose it, since it is so small and black.CONCLUSIONSI love this little headset for how small, attractive and the A2DP features, but the fact that people can't hear and understand me is so disappointing.After pouring over reviews and wanting to find a perfect version of this headset, I bought the Aliph Jawbone Icon Series - The Thinker Bluetooth.

But they're a necessary evil if you use your phone while you drive. This Jabra BT headset is the first one I've ever used that didn't make me furious and didn't irritate my callers.______________Connection:Pairing this device was very simple. It took just a couple of seconds. I tried it both on my iPhone (which I expected to be simple) and my wife's Nextel Blackberry (which I expected to be a pain, because everything on that phone is a pain). I was very pleased with the pairing on both of these phones. It went very quickly and I'm sure my wife could have figured it out quickly too (she hates gadgets).______________Call Quality:My wife and I experimented with calling each other with and without the BT headset, to and from a landline. The quality was good enough that we couldn't tell whether we were using the BT or just the phone. That either means that the quality of the headset is very good, or that cell phone call quality is still not that great. :)______________Fit:This is the one area where I can't give this BT device a perfect score. Although the over-ear fit is very comfortable for me and for my wife, the earpiece itself doesn't fit in my wife's ear very well. Her ear-hole is too small for the speaker. We experimented with some of the replacement accessories, but it just won't fit her ear correctly.______________Charging:I like the home and car chargers included with this device. The charger uses a standard mini-USB, so I don't have to add another charger to my car if I already have a device with that size cable. The battery life is good too, so I don't have to recharge the device all the time.All in all, I AM a nerd, but I don't want to LOOK like one. So I only use this in the car for driving & talking. I don't wear this in the grocery store or at my desk at work.

As a restoration contractor I have to climb around attics and under houses.  I have tried all brands and styles of Bluetooth earpieces and the Jabra Extreme is by far the best for 3 reasons:1). By far it has the best assembly to keep in your ear.  The worst thing is having an earpiece that falls off, considering the floor can be 3 stories below.  All other brands are liars when it comes to claims of staying in your ear.  This Jabra is the best.2).  It is a good friend.  The biggest selling point should be it's ability to play music, podcasts and also  streaming audio off the Internet.  We are not supposed to have music on many  jobs but I can listen to all my favorite shows without any one knowing, and still have an ear free to hear what is going on around me and talk to my crews.  I have had to work in some real lonely, hard places and this Jabra has really provided some good comfort.  When we can have music my guys can listen to their music and I can get my podcasts in.  And unlike radios the music goes where I go.  I have not found another ear piece that can do this.3). Everything else.  Long battery life, car and wall charger included, charges fast, easy pairing, lightweight.  Can talk to people clearly on loud job sites.  Can voice command my smartphone from my earpiece.  Pauses audio during calls and resumes playback after call.  Pretty much can manage phone calls and keep on working uninterrupted.

{"reviewerID": "A2BMZRO0H7TFCS", "asin": "B001GD87QO", "reviewerName": "Ed", "helpful": [144, 148], "reviewText": "The last two Bluetooth headsets that I used were thePlantronics Discovery 925and Plantronics Discovery 975.  They were my favorite headsets among the many I have used since I started wearing them in 2005.  Unfortunately, I gave the 925 to my father and my 975 had to be sent in for warranty service.  When Amazon offered the Jabra Extreme for me to review, I jumped hard and fast.  Would it be an acceptable temporary solution until I got my 975 back, or would it be something else?PROS:- Attractive design- Diminutive size- Good sound quality- Good noise cancellation- Dedicated power switch- Great range- Multipoint & A2DP compatibility- Multiuse (connect 2 devices at the same time)- FANTASTIC accessories included- Comfortable fit (for me)- Fair battery life (5.5 hours talk/10.5 standby)- Multiple charging options- Great value for price pointCONS:- Volume buttons a bit tiny- May not be comfortable for some ears- AC charger cord length is extremely shortThe unheralded Jabra EXTREME has hit one out of the park folks.  Not only did I find it to be a good solution while I waited for my Plantronics Discovery 975 to come back from service, but I think the 975 may just end up becoming my backup headset.  The Jabra EXTREME is very similar to theJabra BT 530but the EXTREME has improved noise cancellation, Multipoint, Multiuse, Acoustic Shock Protection, and A2DP music streaming.  In fact, if you look at the back of the EXTREME headset, you'll see the BT530 model # imprinted on it.  Make no mistake though, the EXTREME is significantly improved.PAIRINGThe EXTREME goes into pairing mode the first time it is turned on and my Motorola Droid found it quickly and paired without having to enter a code.FITIf you have read my other Bluetooth headset reviews, you know that fit is a HUGE deal for me.  The EXTREME admirably attempts to accommodate most users by providing a couple of ear hook sizes, a normal ear gel and also what Jabra calls, Ultimate-fit ear gels.  Plantronics has a similar ear gel technology and I have to admit that Plantronics' implementation is more comfortable and fits better.  After trying different combinations of ear gels and hooks, I ended up just using the normal ear gel without the hooks.  It is secure enough that I could probably go jogging with it and not fall out.  It's not quite as comfortable as the Plantronics Discovery 925/975, but definitely good enough for at least an hour of continuous use.STYLEThough the EXTREME probably won't win any style awards, I find it to be very attractive.  The design is subdued and the gunmetal gray front looks sharp.  Also, since the headset isn't very large, it will probably attract less attention to the fact that you are wearing a Bluetooth headset.  I used to think that the Plantronics Discovery 925/975 looked very stylish and I thought I looked ok while wearing them until I started watching \"24\" Season 8.  Everyone in CTU wears the Discovery 975 and well, I think they all look ridiculous.CALL & MUSIC QUALITYJabra has finally decided to use dual mics in their noise cancellation technology, similar to how Plantronics and Aliph have.  Jabra calls theirs, Noise Blackout EXTREME.  And like Plantronics' AudioIQ2, it works.  It cancels out background noise very well so that the person on the other end of the call can hear you clearly.  The EXTREME also automatically adjusts the volume of the call so that in noisy environments, you can hear the caller more clearly.  To protect your ears against sudden loud noises, it also has what they call, Acoustic Shock Protection.  A welcome feature addition to the EXTREME is support for A2DP which allows you to listen to music from your device via the headset.  It's in mono, so it doesn't sound great, but it is certainly good enough for casual music listening, NPR and for podcasts.BATTERY & CHARGINGThe battery life is about average for a modern Bluetooth headset and it takes 2 hours to fully charge.  I found that it came almost fully charged however and only needed about 15 minutes to charge the first time.  I was ecstatic with the charging options included with the Jabra EXTREME.  It comes with a USB car charger and includes a detachable piece that you can use to plug the headset into and charge it through ANY powered USB port.  So, you could be charging your headset on the way to work in your car and finish charging it in your office from your laptop.  Awesome!  I am baffled by the short cord on the AC charger though.  I'm guessing they shortened it thinking most people charge their headsets from a counter-top wall outlet, but I don't.  My chargers are usually on the floor behind my desk.  Lucky for me, since the headset uses a micro-USB port, I use my Motorola Droid's charger at my desk to charge both.BUTTONSA welcome feature on the Jabra EXTREME is a dedicated power switch.  I have never had a headset that paired as quickly as the EXTREME.  Whenever I flip the power switch on, my Droid pairs within 5 seconds.  It also has an answer/end button and a volume up and a volume down button.  The volume buttons are rather small, but you get used to them.  Also, when you aren't on a call, if you push either of the volume buttons, it acts as a battery life indicator.  Green means 1-4.5 hours of talk time remaining, yellow means 10 minutes to 1 hour of time remaining, and red means less than 10 minutes of talk time remaining.SUMMARYI was never a fan of Jabra Bluetooth headsets until now.  Most never fit well or were comfortable.  Jabra has finally made one that is reasonably comfortable to use, though they could do even better.  The call quality, advanced noise cancellation, charging options and very low MSRP, make the Jabra EXTREME an amazing value and my choice for use in the car.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Enough", "unixReviewTime": 1266796800, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2010"}

It comes with pretty standard accessories: a car power adapter, a wall charger, three different eargels and two removable ear hoops. Most people should be able to get a comfortable, adequate fit.The headset features a mechanical on/off switch, separate volume +/- keys, and an action button. Charging is done via a micro USB connector; thank you Jabra for choosing a ubiquitous standard instead of inflicting yet another proprietary connector on us.The wall charger is a pretty standard micro USB charger, but the car adapter is really nifty: a combination of a small cigarette lighter adapter with female USB plug, and a clever articulated USB to micro USB adapter. Thanks to this well thought out gadget, you can charge the headset in your car without ending up with a tangled mess of wires.The headset itself is very lightweight and you can wear it for extended periods of time without any inconvenience. And that's a great thing, because the battery life on this thing is fantastic. Jabra claims 5 1/2 hours of talk time, and I had no problems reaching that (no, not in one sitting, sheesh!). The stand-by life is a spectacular 10 days, and I assume if you turn off the power when you don't need it you could go on for months without having to recharge it.Bluetooth functionality is top-notch: the Extreme can pair with up to 8 devices and be connected to two of them simultaneously. Connections establish very quickly, and the audio is remarkably interference-free, unlike most of my other bluetooth headsets which can get staticky when the phone is not in direct line of sight of the headset. According to the manual it even supports A2DP (hifi stereo over bluetooth) which can be useful if you want to listen to radio over your headset -- although this feature is more at home on a stereo headset.Audio quality is absolutely unbelievable. I made a call from my car with the radio at a regular volume and the person I was talking to only heard my voice. I had to crank the radio all the way up before they were able to hear it. I made another call from the car in while it was raining heavily and the other party could hear only my voice loud and clear.So, is it perfect? Pretty close. I would like to see it ship with a few more choices of gels and earloops, and a carry case or a necklace like the one Plantronics bundles with their headset. These minor quibbles aside, I have to say this is by far the best bluetooth headset I've ever used, and I've used a lot of them.PROS----- Spectacular audio quality, no interference, noise elimination works even better than advertised- Tiny and lightweight- Simple, well positioned controls with tactile feedback- Uses standard microUSB charging connector- Mechanical on/off switch- Amazing battery life- Well designed car chargerCONS----- limited choice of included eargels and earloops- no bundled carry caseUnder its deceivingly ordinary looks, the Jabra Extreme hides an exceptionally well engineered headset that manages to deliver more than the marketing hype.

But the more I worked with it the more disappointed I became.One of the things I liked about it was that it came with a nice little charging stand which is good because while I always remember my phone, my bluetooth headset gets lost in the clutter and is usually forgotten. Pairing with my Samsung smartphone was a piece of cake.But then came trying to stick it in my ear. The picture shows you a plastic clip to help it stay put in your ear. Unfortunately, that clip comes off so easily that I could not get it to stay on and around my ear at the same time. So I figured that it was small enough that if it was properly seated in my ear and I wasn't moving much, it would probably work. But then I couldn't figure out how to get the earpiece to settle into my ear. It came with several and I tried all of them but again, I guess I just have these freakish ears that are hard to fit.I finally got the best fit I could so came for the moment of truth of actually using it to make a call. The sound quality was ok but not significantly better than other headphones and not better than using my cell phone directly. I went outside where there was more noise and while you could tell there was some noise cancelling, it wasn't \"EXTREME\" like the name would imply.My biggest complaint though is with the controls. The size of this headset is probably the smallest I have seen which is great because it has a very low \"dork factor\". However, the buttons are so small and close together that you are constantly fiddling with it to find the right one. More often than not, I just didn't. I suppose if you used it all the time, you would get used to it. But I'm unusual in that I really don't use my cell phone that much so I never really got comfortable with it -- though I tried very hard! I used it for over a month.To summarize:Pros:------- very low profile and sleek form factor... virtually no \"dork factor\"-- easy to set up and use-- Battery life as good as it comesCons:------- hard to fit in my ears-- clip doesn't stay put making for an insecure fit in your head.-- controls are hard to use because it is so small-- while there is some noise cancelling, it is not what I would consider \"EXTREME\"I really wanted to like this headset but it just wasn't a great fit for me.[NCJVR]", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I didn't care for it -- the controls are too small to comfortably use", "unixReviewTime": 1270944000, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2010"}

I have been a constant user of Plantronics Bluetooth headsets ever since Bluetooth headsets appearing en masse and I consider them among the best out there. This is the first time I will be using a Jabra brand.First off, I like the design of this Bluetooth device. With a variety of gels and hooks for the ears, you can be assured of a comfort and exact fit. I especially like the hooks where it doesn't get in the way even if you are wearing a hat or eyeglasses. Unlike the thick hooks of the current Plantronics brand I use, Jabra's ear hooks are well molded. The different-sized ear gels are also another great advantage to ensure a secure fit and it is very comfortable. I even forget I am wearing this when worn for an extended period of time.Set up and pairing wasn't a problem either. It didn't take long for my MyTouch 3G to find this device. Once paired, I took it for a test run. The sound quality of this device is superior to most headsets I have used. When in the car, I made a call and you can feel the noise-canceling feature of this device. The ambient background noise are instantly minimized when you are in a call. The noise canceling feature does its job even when the car radio is turned on. It doesn't block out the noise completely but minimizes it to a degree where you can have decent conversation even with ambient noise.Another plus feature is being able to utilize a car-charger and a USB charger.

If it had a better charger, I would likely have rated it with four stars rather than three.The charger is only a foot long. Yes, 12 inches. This means it cannot be plugged into an electrical  outlet that isn't next to your desk if you mean to lay it on the desk while charging. In fact, I placed a power strip under my coffee table, which is considerably lower in height than a desk. I still could not set the headset on top of the coffee table while plugged into the power strip under the table - the cord just does not reach.So unless you want to charge this headset in the bathroom or kitchen where there are outlets at the level of the counter, you will have to lay this headset on the floor while charging it. In my home, that makes it fair game for a cat to play with. I'm guessing the same may be true of homes with dogs.Sure, you could stretch a power strip so it rests on top of a table or desk, but this is unsightly and uses precious real estate on that surface, all for the sake of a headset that should have been designed better.The second area where Jabra failed on this one is that they only provide a full user manual on their website. When I read this in the manual that came with the device, I wasn't overly concerned as I thought it would be no issue to download that manual.That's where I was wrong. The manual is on the website, sure, but it is not in a standard format that can be downloaded to a PC or Smartphone for use offline. No, Jabra only provides the full manual in an interactive online format so you must be connected to the internet and view it on their website. That is all well and good when you have internet available to you, but I don't want to have to rely on internet access to look at the product manual. I want to be able to store the PDF on my PC and my smartphone so that I can refer to it any time I need to.The sound quality is decent, as I said before.

I haven't yet run out of charge when talking, which is a great indicator that the talk-time is good since I use my cell phone frequently and only with a Bluetooth headset.But the two failures are big enough for me that I can't rate it more than three stars, which is generous in my opinion.

The Jabra EXTREME is pretty comfortable in my right ear and usually delivers good reception with my BlackBerry Storm 2 smartphone. That said, reception/call quality isn't as reliable as what I've grown to expect from my Plantronics Voyager Pro Bluetooth Headset. The Jabra EXTREME is more comfortable to wear than the Plantronics headset I own, but sometimes voices drop out when I use the Jabra and I have to ask people to repeat what they've said.On that note, the volume buttons on the Jabra are pretty small and that makes it difficult to adjust the volume while driving without taking your attention off the road.

It's not half bad, but definitely not the best I've tried.Call Quality:People tell me I sound clear with good vocal tone when using this headset, and I don't have to speak very loud to be heard -- that's the benefit of dual mics at work -- they do a good job of picking up my voice while eliminating background noise.My first foray into dual mics was the BlueAnt V1, and to this day, it remains the best headset I've used by far. At the time, I predicted dual mics would become standard in all headsets due to their superior ability to separate noise while maintaining natural voice quality. The concept is similar to seeing with two eyes or hearing music in stereo -- dual mics just do a better job than one mic alone. Inferior noise canceling headsets filter noise at the expense of voice quality, but the dual mics help this Jabra do a decent job in the noise canceling department.On the flipside, listening to people speak to me through this Jabra is slightly less stellar. People sound slightly muffled, as if they're inside a box. Its not horrible, but certainly could be better.No Annoyingly Huge LEDs:I hate headsets with huge LEDs that scream, \"HI EVERYONE, I'M ON THE PHONE!\" It's minor, but I sure love that this headset only has one tiny LED. Lately, I've been developing a pet peeve with electronics that have needlessly large LEDs. It's as if every little piece of technology out there needs to declare its own self-worth via a blinking--flashing--glowing, something or other. Or more accurately, most tech developers seem to think big, shiny, sparkly luminescence will attract us to their products like hapless primates mesmerized by their first glimpse of flame. Thankfully, the Jabra Extreme just has the one tiny LED -- plenty big for anyone with eyes to see, yet small enough to be subtle.Comfort and FitThe Jabra Extreme feels comfortable in my ear and came with several different earpieces, which is always nice. It also came with two sizes of ear loops, though I was hoping I wouldn't need them. I've often eyed people who wear their headsets without an ear loop but never felt confident enough to try it myself. I imagined I'd constantly be adjusting the fit or worrying about losing my headset. But when I read the manual for this Jabra, I saw it came with a special earpiece that apparently made it possible to wear the headset without an ear loop. The headset is definitely small and light, so I figured it was worth a shot. At first, it stayed in my ear just fine without the ear loop -- well, at least while I was home. Unfortunately, the concept didn't hold up in a real world setting. As I went about my day, I constantly had to fiddle with the fit to keep the headset from falling off. I don't know about you, but I have more important things to do than constantly futz with my headset. It drove me nuts and I couldn't wait to get back home so I could put the ear loop back on and forget about it.Simple On/Off SwitchAnother thing I really appreciate about this Jabra is that it has a hard on/off switch -- and I don't mean the switch is hard to use, I mean it's an actual switch that clicks on, then clicks off. Anyone else noticed how such a simple thing has become a scarcity with electronics? Everything has a multifunction button -- tap once to do this, hold for 3 seconds to do that, tap twice for the other thingy..... I've come to appreciate a simple switch like the one on this Jabra that just clicks on and off -- and no flashy lights or anything either -- just a red mark showing when it's off and a green mark showing when it's on -- simple, efficient, easy and unmistakable -- perfect!Button SpacingThe call answer button and volume buttons are a bit cramped and can be tricky to operate when wearing the headset. I often thought I accidentally hung up on someone when I was just trying to adjust the volume. But I got accustomed to the layout the more I used it and rarely change the volume much, so it shouldn't prove to be an issue very often. Just be aware if you have big fingers or aren't good with spatial awareness, these buttons aren't going to work well for you. And as far as I can tell, there's no way to reassign the volume up and down buttons, so if you wear your headset on your left ear instead of your right, as I do, then your volume buttons will be upside-down -- volume up will be on the bottom and volume down on the top -- intuitively reverse. Placing the volume buttons side by side or allowing them to be remapped would have been better.AttachmentsThis Extreme comes with a car charger, a wall outlet charger and a USB charger for your computer. I thought it was a nice touch to include all three methods. And as I mentioned, it also comes with multiple earpiece attachments and 2 ear loops.Easy To Open Packaging:It's also worth mentioning that this Jabra is packaged well and is easy to open. If you've ever bought something that seems hermetically sealed and is near impossible to open, you'll appreciate the simple packaging of this Jabra.Bottom Line:This Jabra Extreme is pretty good, but I still give my 18 month old BlueAnt V1 the edge over every other bluetooth headset I've tried -- you just can't beat the BlueAnt's talking menus and superior noise canceling. But if you want a totally pared down yet reliable bt headset, this Jabra will serve you well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Extreme(ly) Good - But BlueAnt V1 is still the Best", "unixReviewTime": 1267142400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2010"}

When I started looking for a new Bluetooth headset I was concerned. It sounded as if the only acceptable units put all the functions of a smartphone in your ear. Personally - I use my headset to talk to people. This headset does that - and it does it well.In addition to making conversations simple - it has the A2DP functions - so navigation is clearly heard through your headset, not your speaker on the dash a few feet away from you. It allows me to put my phone in a great spot for navigation, and clear visibility, and still hear directions clearly. Sure A2DP can be used for music, and that's nice, but it's really the connection to a few specific apps that I use it for.Sometimes I get a bit jealous that other headsets have loads of options and store your contacts, but I don't need those. Sometimes I wish I had a headset that read my texts and emails for me - then I remember how many I can get in a day.The Good:* Fit is very comfortable for me without the 'earhook' - though it's good to have as a backup option* The options for charging are fantastic!- the car charger adapter- 'ratcheting' USB connector (for car adapter or computer)- wall plug* Connects/Reconnects quickly* Range is very good* Smaller than expected (much less intrusive than my old Plantronics unit)* Buttons seem well placed and easy to access for me ( though I have fairly large hands)* Battery Life - unsure. I haven't run out yet. Love that it stops charging itself when it's finished* A2DP for easy navigation (even with the windows down)The bad:When I think about it... nothing for me.There are a few subjective things that you may or may not find annoying or pleasing. The fact that it doesn't blink incessantly was initially troublesome. I wasn't sure it was working - turns out it's great, especially at night. I also found the lack of tones for some functions was initially off-putting. Now I realize it's also great. I don't need it to send me a tone - I need to hang up, call someone back, answer a call or whatever it is that I'm asking it to do. I never realized having a unique tone for all of these was annoying until I discovered the only reason I needed them with my old set - was because it so frequently didn't do them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job well with no surprises or gimmicks.", "unixReviewTime": 1335744000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2012"}

My Plantronics is rather bulky and would definitely not win any \"best looking\" awards.

I decided to NOT read the instructions to see if I could figure it out on my own. I set my phone to serach for new devices and then held the + button on the headset (hey, it worked with my older headset!).  Sure enough, my phone detected it and was then paired.  I did not have to enter a passcode so that seemed a little weird.  I will check on that later when I finally get around to reading the directions!I called a friends on my Iphone using just the phone and taked for a while.  Ended up needing to call him back a bit later and decided to give the headset a try.  It fits very comfortably and looks a lot better than my Plantronics.  When my friend answered, he came through loud and clear on my end.  I asked him how I sounded and he said the same as before.  He could not tell that I was using a headset.  I never got that response with my old headset as people could always tell.We spoke for about 45 minutes and never had a signal issue.  I was moving around my house with my phone on my counter in my kitchen.

Audio is good. It connects and disconnects very quickly. The buttons are easy to use. Nobody has complained about hearing an echo. The microphone is pretty strong though, and outside noise is readily apparent to the person on the other end. Also, because of the outside noise, it is sometimes impossible for me to use the voice commands on my phone. The headset is comfortable but just does not feel secure and I always feel like I have to adjust it to hear better. It has NOT come off or fallen off, bit it just feels like it might.

Electronics products seem to be plagued with this word the most, as everyone wants people to think their product is one step above excellence.  Well Jabra makes some really impressive headsets, this product included, but I have yet to find one Bluetooth headset that is even close to being worthy of the word \"EXTREME!\"With that being said, I have been using the Jabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headset now for almost a month and I can honestly say that it is one solid performer.  Sound quality (incoming) is pretty good, although not the greatest, and people who have called me claim that my voice sounds very crisp and clear.  However, they also claim that they can still hear a fair amount of background noise.  In fact, one caller described the noise as being rather \"focused,\" as if certain sounds were muted but other sounds were being amplified.  So for noise cancelling I would say it is on par or slightly better than some of the other dual mic., noise cancelling headsets that I have tested from Motorola and Plantronics.  I do not consider slightly better as being \"Extreme.\"The one thing I have never really liked about many headsets out there is the ear-gels they use for holding them in your ear.  I realize that fit and feel are a matter of preference, but I find that I must fidget with them way too much to get them in my ear properly.  Meanwhile I might be driving down the road and spending way too much time playing around with my headset.  If they made a type that fit in your ear, in a similar fashion to ear bud style music headphones, I think I would be far happier.  But for now my favorite design is the kind that sits over my ear instead of in the ear.  That way I can pop the headset on and off in seconds, without any fiddling around.  But again, this is strictly a matter of personal preference.  As far as how good the Jabra Extreme feels, I can only say that it is extremely light, very small, and the ear-gels are on par with just about all other Jabra headsets to date.  I think the ear hook should be flared out just a bit on the end, so that you don't poke your ear with it when putting it on.So overall I would break down my rating of this device as follows:Visual Appeal  =  4-starsFit & Feel  =  3-starsNoise Cancelation  =  4-starsSound Quality  =  4-starsControls / Ease of Use  =  3-starsWireless Communication (between headset and phone)  =  4-starsI would say the Jabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headset is a solid 4-star device, which puts it above average in my book.  But the only that I would consider \"extreme\" about this headset is the teeny size of the control buttons.  I can barely feel them when trying to adjust the volume.  I do recommend this headset, as I feel it is a quality built device that is a step above most other headsets in this price range.  However, I think Jabra, as well as every other manufacturer out there, should not just throw around the word `extreme' so loosely.  I they can produce a product that is truly excellent in nearly every manner, then by all means call it Extreme.  Eventually the word `extreme' will mean nothing to consumers, as we will eventually define the word, mentally, as \"better than average.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good But Not EXTREME", "unixReviewTime": 1271289600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A1N5FSCYN4796F", "asin": "B001GD87QO", "reviewerName": "Philip R. Heath \"Gadgets, Music, & Books\"", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "I have used a number of Bluetooth headsets in the past (Motorola H700, LG HBM-730, Jabra BT-350, Plantronics Explorer 320, Motorola HS850, and Jabra BT-250), but I had larger given them up in favor of myMotorola T305 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker(see my review).  However, Bluetooth headsets have come a long way in the last two and a half years so I decided that it was worth having a look at the Jabra EXTREME.  I base my evaluation of the Jabra EXTREME on the following criteria:  pairing, sound quality, ease of use, comfort, and extras.Pairing:  This is an area that headset makers (and Bluetooth device makers in general) have improved over the years.  After completing the initial charge the headset automatically goes into pairing mode when turned on as indicated by the purple/blue sequence of the indicator light.  All I had to do was have myBlackBerry Curve 8330 Phone, Silver (Verizon Wireless)(see my review) search for new Bluetooth devices.  It found the Jabra EXTREME without issue, and the two were paired after punching in the standard \"0000\" code.Sound Quality:  I had pretty high expectations for the EXTREME based on the product description.  However, I didn't find it to be substantially better than my prior Jabra headsets or my Motorola speakerphone.  On my end, callers sounded as clear as they do when not using a headset.  This is not groundbreaking though.  Unfortunately and to my disappointment callers reported that the EXTREME did not sound substantially different than my prior Bluetooth devices.  It seems that it is still a mystery for device makers to create a transparent experience for callers on the other end.  My wife reported the usual cut-in cut-out crackling as I would begin to and finish talking.  I would have expected more based on both the midrange price point and the technological advancements.Ease of Use:  This was the area where I noticed the most progress over prior Jabra devices.  Jabra has realized that a separate power button is a necessity.  I never liked having to hold down the multi-function button for an extended period to power devices on and off.  I would either fail to turn the device on or wind up redialing the last number called rather than turning it off.  The multi-function button is also more tactile in being both smaller yet more pronounced in the amount it is raised from the surface.  The one area users may have trouble with is the volume buttons.  These are fairly small, and users with bigger fingers could find them hard to operate.  However, I found the default volume to be sufficient for my liking so this was a non-issue.  Your mileage may vary.  One final note, the included instruction manual is quite brief.  While it is sufficient for getting started, users may have to go online to get the detailed manual if they run into any problems.  This is a cost saving measure, but it may frustrate Bluetooth neophytes.Comfort:  Jabra has gone out of their way to accommodate a variety of users by including two different sized earhooks along with left and right eargels designed for \"hookless\" use.  While the variety is thoughtful, the earhooks are a pretty major failure.  Their makeup is similar to the sock hangers used to hang up a pair of dress socks in a department store.  However, the earhooks may actually be less flexible than the sock hangers.  Unless one of these earhooks happens to fit the shape of your ear perfectly, you are not likely to find the earhook a viable option.  At this point I was rather concerned as I had never used a headset without an earhook.  So I changed out the default eargel for the right eargel and situated the EXTREME in my right ear.  I was pleased that it fit fairly comfortably and securely.  I shook my head up and down as well as left and right, but the headset never hinted at falling out.  I even jumped up and down to try to force it loose, but it didn't budge.  I have found this manner of wearing to be sufficiently comfortable during commutes of 30-60 minutes.  However, I left it in for a little over two hours when working from home one morning, and I exceeded the limits of comfort.  While it didn't bother me prior, my ear was quite sore once I removed the headset.  It did not linger, and two hours might be beyond the reasonable amount of time to expect to wear a headset in comfort anyway.Extras:  This is another area where Jabra was quite thoughtful.  In addition to the variety of wearing options, Jabra has included both wall and car chargers for the EXTREME.  The car charger is actually in two pieces with a USB connector.  This allows for the adapter to also be used in a PC USB port.  Given the midrange pricing of the EXTREME, users will expect some level of extras, and it is good that Jabra included these.Conclusion:  The Jabra EXTREME is a competent Bluetooth headset, but it doesn't quite set itself apart as much as its description might suggest.  If you are already happy with another Bluetooth headset, you will be better served waiting until it is time for a replacement.  Users in the market for a new headset will find that the EXTREME performs sufficient for inclusion in the midrange class of headsets.  If you have demanding requirements for sound quality, you may be better off going into the upper tier of headsets from other manufacturers such as Jawbone.

MSakamoto \"boy clothes\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "Summary: My three favorite BT headsets are the Plantronics Voyager ProPlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset, Aliph Jawbone (original version) and now the Jabra Extreme. All of them have their pluses and minuses, but I think i would give the slight nod to the Jabra at this point due to its ease of use.Pros:* Rapid paring and quick response to all controls. It's quick enough that I never find myself waiting for it to connect, disconnect, turn on/off, etc. Pairing with my Blackberry Tour (Verizon) and Macbook Pro (15.4\", OSX 10.5.8) went without a hitch of any kind. With multiple device connection, I can use my cell and VOIP at the same time. Very cool!* A \"real\" on/off switch. It's tiny, but the unit has a small slider switch with positive stops for on/off. I like this a lot better than units that need you to hold a button down for a certain length of time to turn on/off or signal pairing. The JE just turns on and off. Seems like a small thing, but it's really big to me, especially since I am red/green color blind.* Range is good. I didn't test it to disconnect, but I could go to the next room in my house (about 20' and a wall) away from my BB and maintain connection.* Small and decent looking. Fit and finish are great and the packaging makes it all seem special. Feels high quality.* The buttons are clearly labeled. I can also actually hit them with my nominally size fingertips.* The best power/charger accessories I have seen for a BT headset. The units comes with a tiny USB converter plug that has a full sized USB on one end and a micro-USB on the other. You can then plug this into the supplied car charger, which has a USB plug on the end, or plug it into your PC. Very cool. One reviewer mentioned that the AC cord is too short, but for my setup it was about right because I have a 12 plug power bar running across the top back of my desk (not too stylish, but effective), and a long cord just gets in the way. Altogether, I thought this was all well thought out and well done, especially at the price.* The aforementioned charger system plugs into Micro USB, which is becoming very common and thus makes it a non-disaster if you forget the charger.* The sound is on par with my other high end headsets at half the price. I have found, as another reviewer did, that listening to single ear music is OK, and the sound from the JE is defiinitely \"Better than nothing\" when it comes down to waiting in lines, etc.* Comfort is OK, probably a solid \"good\".Cons* My Voyager Pro is more comfotable. For me, the \"around the ear\" loops of the JE do not work well. My best combo is the in-ear rubber gel with no ear hook. Definitely need to try all the combos to get a good one.* The instruction manual is just a little bit too sparse for comfort. For instance, it doesn't detail how to change the ear gels. I figured it out, but took longer than I should since it was not apparent that the ear gels just peel off instead of having an interlock and twist like the Jawbone or the PVP. Also, the manual was written by someone who had English as a second or third language. This doesn't keep the experienced user from succeeding, but it might mean that some of us may not get to all the neat features right away, or ever. I think they could have spared a couple more pages of explanation for multiple pairing, use with a PC, and the procedure for changing the earpiece. Since they already had pictures in the manual, a couple more sentences is all that is needed.* The aforementioned beloved power slider switch does not have a label to tell you which dicrection is on or off. Seems like a screwy omission. You figure it out quickly, but it did mess me up the first couple times out since \"down\" is on and \"up\" is off. On/Off or \"0\" \"1\", please.ConclusionI like it and it has become my new primary headset over the Voyager Pro and the Jawbone original.

Eisenberg \"Keeping it real since 1959\"", "helpful": [5, 7], "reviewText": "Hard to be unimpressed by the packaging, love it or hate it- they say you only get one chance to make a first impression- and since, to me at least, most diminutive Bluetooth headsets look pretty mush alike at a distance, the Jabra is presented like a museum piece- held up for display on a clear plastic pedestal, and enclosed in a clear plastic display case. All that was missing were pin spots, it must certainly stand out on a retail shelf. But I must add- do we need the plastic already? Once it's out of the box, I am seriously not going to put it back on display every night. How about a postpaid recycling envelope?Included in the package is the AC charger, as well as a 12v automotive adapter- I like this part- it plugs directly into the lighter socket, an adjustable elbow then connects to it and allows the headset to be plugged in to standby via a standard micro-USB charging connector. It's a little awkward to try to get it off and in your ear in time to catch a call, but it's a great way to keep it charged and handy. The AC adapter has a one foot cord, which also seems to be a love/hate thing. I love it; most of the time I charge on a bathroom counter so it's perfect.The set comes with both over-the-ear hooks or inserts for in-ear, the unit is light enough to not require very much external support. They refer to them as \"Ultimate-fit ear gels\" but to my eyes (and ear), they're just a flexible rubber or silicon cap.I do not like driving with any more distractions than already available and am not inclined (or use the phone enough) to keep the thing on all the time- so it is important to be able to have it in place and comfortable quickly- especially while wearing glasses. The Jabra is great at this, although using one of the in-ear pieces that have a small hook, it is a little more difficult to insert, with a chance you will press one of the controls. I am sure with time this can be forgotten. It's also small enough that if you did choose to leave it in, and have even moderately long hair, it's barely visible.Controls are simple and easy to access, effective, virtually no learning curve. The power switch is a raised slider and always easy to find and hit should the need arise.I have to say I am under-impressed by the \"dual microphone noise canceling\" as advertised, the quality is great but certainly, at least as I have so far used it, not exceptional. I should add: field testing an audio device of any kind is highly subjective and there are just too many variables to come to any sort of controlled conclusion. But recipients of calls made did not find anything worthy of note in the quality.Using my older Nokia phone, the instructions mention voice activation can be operated from the answer/end button, but this was not the case for my phone.The manual  is bare bones, but you don't really need much more. They state in the book that \"online user manuals\" can be found at their website, the Jabra website is very accessible and any additional information you seek may be found there. But, do not expect a detailed downloadable PDF- the information is there but in a more casual way. This device is so simple to operate, I can't really see how much more information you'd need .I checked out their tutorial about pairing to see if my phone would even work with it- and discovered that my previous phone, RIP, was also listed as compatible- when in fact it had no Bluetooth capability.

No problem whatsoever.  Mom heard me loud and clear and I spent most of the call trying to convince her that I was using a headset.  She was convinced I had my phone right up to my face.  Please note, at no time did I have to talk above an average voice.  In fact, I kept talking softer and softer, trying to test the limits of the device, but not once did she have an issue hearing me.  This has been the case with other calls I've made using this headset.  So far, I haven't found a condition where my voice has been drowned out by outside noise.It should also be said that my voice is coming through with quality, and on the receiving end, I can hear those I'm talking to without any issues.  Just as importantly, while using this device when I have other people in the car with me, I have found that they cannot overhear any part of the persons comments coming through over the line.  In fact, when I'm using this headset and have the car radio on, the other people in the car can't really hear what I'm saying either (because I'm able to talk at a reasonably low volume without losing quality), so I can virtually have a private conversation and not bother those around me.Second, the unobtrusive design of this device should be noted.  For whatever reason, I'm adverse to big or flashy headsets, and so this device is near perfect for me.  It's extremely light and small.  It fits in my ear securely, and nothing I do is going to shake it out.  Just as nice, it comes out of my ear easily when I want to take it out.  It's small enough and sleek enough to where not only do I not feel self-conscious wearing it, but I usually forget I have it in.  I have not found any major discomfort while wearing it.  With that said, I have not worn it for any stretch over 30 minutes, and I sometimes have experienced a few seconds of discomfort immediately after taking it out.  I have this issue with other devices, so this may be more a quirk with me than a knock on the headset.As a final note on the design, I appreciate the intuitive layout of the buttons.  Each one gives you a definite \"click\" when you press it and they are laid out in such a way where you always know which one you are pressing.  These are very helpful features when you have a device in your ear that you are trying to adjust on the go.If I have any complaints about this headset, they are minor.  For instance, why did they include a wall charger that has a ridiculously short cord?  It's honestly an eight or ten inch cord at most, but, like I said, this is a minor complaint.  Certainly, I did not find any reason to dock this device a star.

It is fairly comfortable and comes with two sizes of ear loops.  I had to replace the smaller loop with the larger loop, and then it fit quite well.  There is also an option to just stick it directly in your ear, with no loop, but I did not try that option.  I previously had a larger Motorola headset, and I like the smaller size of this Jabra.One of my complaints with the Motorola was that it was too hard to hear, even with the volume at max.  This one has a much better speaker, and I found both the volume and quality of the sound from the other person to be excellent.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the quality of my voice to the other person, but I'll get to that.I also liked that it was very easy to pair with my iPhone, as the headset goes into automatic-pairing mode the first time you turn it on.  You just ask the iPhone to find it, and voila!When you first put this headset on and start using it, it seems fantastic.But then I did a test of my voice quality by leaving myself several voice mail messages and then playing them back.  I like doing this since it lets me hear my voice from the headset immediately after my voice from the greeting, so it's easy to compare.  This test failed miserably.  Even though I was speaking loudly into the headset, my voice played back to me sounded like I was in a room speaking into a speaker phone and far away from that speaker phone.  It was tinny and hard to hear.  If the caller on the other end doesn't have good volume on his/her end, he/she may not be able to hear you.  On the other hand, it's not much worse than speaking into a Bluetooth hands free car kit, but I expect better from an ear-mounted unit than from my car's built-in mic.My other complaints are minor compared to the quality and volume of how other callers hear me.First, the length of the included power cord is quite humorous.  To give you an idea of how short it is, I plugged it into a household wall outlet, and the cord is so short, that the headset doesn't even hit the floor when hanging down from the outlet!  Imagine if you need to charge this via an outlet in a typical office, you will have to have the headset dangling from an outlet under your desk!  Hopefully, you have an outlet up on our desk.The good news, however, is that it includes a USB adapter, so you can simply charge it from your computer instead.  Still, I got a laugh out of the world's shortest power cord.  Not sure what they were thinking.If you care about the environment, you will be alarmed at the product's packaging.  It is irresponsibly packaged inside a large, clear hard-plastic case that will never break down.  When you buy this headset, you are sticking a large plastic casing into a landfill.  I had no idea that companies were still using this type of packaging in the 21st century.Bottom line is I still haven't found a Bluetooth headset that provides as good of quality as using the iPhone's wired earbuds.  And that's a shame, since it would be great to ditch the wires.This one provides you with good audio, but not the other way around to your caller.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good audio for you, bad for the other person", "unixReviewTime": 1266883200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2010"}

And I've owned plenty of them (see my reviews on Plantronics, Motorola, etc.)The negative I'll get out of the way first as one is totally absurd to me (as to why a company would do the first) is the length of the charging cord.  From the actual AC charger that plugs into the wall to the adapter which plugs into the Bluetooth the cord is around six inches!!!  So most likely you'll need an extension cord and/or long power strip.  Now if you have an outlet in an open area then this is not a problem.The last I'll call a negative/positive, is the size of the Bluetooth itself.  The size is so small (and it's powerful in picking up your voice and battery life), but with that comes it being difficult to touch the right buttons, especially if you have large fingers or are wearing it and want to turn the volume down/up.Now keep in mind this is a VERY small bluetooth headset.  Lightweight.  Small so that it's easy loose if you're not careful.  And if you have puffy cheeks the bluetooth will not hit your cheeks and muffle the sound.  So small that many will not notice you are wearing it as it does not protrude along the side of your face.The over the ear part is a small wire, and that's great if you wear glasses as it does not bother the stem of the glasses.  However the first few times you wear it over the ear it'll be difficult to put on and feel strange.  However that feeling goes away after a few times.  And it's very easy to change the wire for Left/Right ear. It comes fit for the right ear and I like wearing them on my left ear.And there is a in ear piece that helps the speaker stay in your ear. With both wire behind the wear and the in ear piece (you don't notice this) you have a true fit bluetooth that does not wiggle around as you move.Pairing was easy.  The on/off button bluetooth is a simple slide up/down.  Range of the bluetooth is a good 20 feet depending on conditions (if you have walls in between or floors or are in an open area, etc.  Battery life is among the best I've seen.Sound quality is very clear.  And callers can hear me clear.Charging has a color system and when it turns green on the headset it's fully charged.  Red means it needs to be charged. Yellowish color means it's in between full/empty.There is also an extra wire for behind the ear.  Extra ear piece.  And a DC car charger.  Having a small bag would of been nice to include, but I'm sure everyone could find something or purchase a small bag to keep it in.Even with the small wire (I can't understand why Jabra would give such a small wire)I'm giving this full stars.  Jabra has a real nice bluetooth here!And again, if you wear glasses or sunglasses, then you will be very happy with this bluetooth as the behind the ear piece is very small and does not bother the stem of your glasses.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Small & Powerful!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1267315200, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2010"}

First had a problem with trackball after couple of months of use. The other one had dead pixels on the screen. So I am on my third device now.  My primary aim for this device is usage of chat software(IM+), emails and internet browsing (Opera Mini). This is by far is one of the best and user friendly devices I have used. It is not laggy as windows mobile devices, The menus can be accessed quickly with no delays. And especially multitasking (which iphone lacks) is a very nice feature that has been helping me a lot while chatting, making a phone call, and watching a video or listening to the music at the same time. Of course I had to update it with the latest firmware update. Before that, I had some java errors and spontaneous reboots, but not anymore. Since the last update I can confirm that I had NO problems whatsoever. I have few complaints though which in my opinion are minor ones and I can live with them. First is the battery life. If I am not using internet very often it may last a day and a half but when I am browsing with Opera Mini or chatting on IM+ the battery drains very quickly so I have to carry another battery with me. Another thing I would prefer to have is a nice youtube player which I can't find anywhere (I tryed a couple of them). And the youtube that plays with a native browser is just garbage, which is kind of sad because other phones like Iphone and HTC touch pro 2 can play youtube quite nicely. And last but not least is the camera. Outdoors, on the bright light you can get more or less decent pictures but if you will try to shoot a video it will come out as a total crap, pixelated with distorted lighting. And the flash isn't helping much either. Unlike for example with Nokia n97 which takes pretty decent pictures and videos. But like I said these things are minor ones and since this phone is being oriented more for a business user you can't expect to have it all. Especially I like the ability to operate this device with one hand only, which comes in handy in many situations, unlike some other phones with larger keyboards I have tried. Of course another nice feature is a multilanguage support which you can not have in windows mobile phones (e.g. convert device and keyboard interface in spanish, german or other language at no charge) Now I am only expecting the release of OS 5.0 which I will immediately install on my device.

The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away. The Bold, with its high resolution screen and the same solid, functional build is a good tool, now with more 'fun' stuff (camera, video playing) added to it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Best and Possibly the Last Classic Blackberry (with a real keyboard)", "unixReviewTime": 1227139200, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2008"}

{"reviewerID": "A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ", "asin": "B001GJ0E4G", "reviewerName": "Jeff Edwards \"RadioJeff\"", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "Okay--right up front, I'll admit it: I have been a die-hard Palm OS addict since I first purchased one of their (ancient) organizers back in the day. I resisted switching to another brand for a slew of reasons, none of which were all that valid--at least not when I look back on it now. The Palm platform was nothing if not user-friendly...I've said it before: those who designed the Palm OS simply must have assumed it would be used by simpletons who were barely above the deep-thinking of your average Neanderthal. My wife & daughter both have Blackberry Curves, and after playing with them on and off, I further refused to consider anything other than Palm because I couldn't figure it out all that quickly. But things change...but I certainly did NOT want to, I can assure you that.About 6-8 months ago, my Palm 755p began giving me trouble. It wasn't very frequent--at first...but after a few weeks of spontaneous re-starts, some at the most unwanted times, I really began to become annoyed. Working in radio, I did a live broadcast remote at a wireless location and started to seriously consider a Windows Mobile phone (in this case, it was a Moto Q9c). I began to slowly research the Moto Q and Windows Mobile phones in particular on the web and also here at amazon.com. What I discovered was other than a select few, the majority of reviews from Windows users were by and large disappointed with their phones. The common thread wasn't the quality of the phones, but the stability of the Operating System itself.This lead me to consider Blackberry...reluctantly, but a kernal of hope took root and before long, my Treo's problems put me on the fast track to getting a phone that only months before I had vowed never to purchase. I would've loved to get another Palm, but having played with the Centro, I found the keyboard actually TOO small for me to comfortably use--and I don't have big fingers, so I think that says a lot right there. I considered a Windows phone made by Palm, but gave up after reading way too many complaints about the OS screwing up way too much. The upcoming Palm Pre looks VERY promising, but my Treo simply wasn't going to last long enough, so I took the plunge.The Bold is out of the box, striking. It's wider than my Treo but MAN is it thinner by a rather large amount--nearly half I'd say.  The keyboard is quite a bit different in several ways...let me explain: some of the icons and symbols are in entirely different locations than what I had become used to with my Treo 650, 700p and subsequent 755p. I thought it would take FOREVER to get used to that, but surprisingly it didn't at all. Also, the keyboard takes advantage of the wider real estate and is spread out further...but the REAL difference (IMO) is my Palm keys were more individual and separated and way higher than on the Bold. Now THIS took some getting used to. On my Palm it was rather easy, even without looking to move my fingers from one key to the next and simply know from that touch alone that I was on a different key. This is not the case with the Bold keyboard. It bothered me--at first, but after a few days, I have become attuned to the difference and it no longer bothers me like it initially did.The next major change is the screen...and boy is this a mighty HUGE change. First off, I have become rather accustomed to using a touch-screen now for quite some time...it was one of my biggest problems with switching to Blackberry. I briefly considered the Storm, but after playing with the virtual keyboard, I ruled that out entirely. I MUST have a keyboard--the virtual one's just don't cut it for me. The other thing is the 100% Upgrade the screen turned out to be compared with the Treo. I've read about it quite a bit and I gotta tell you, until you see it yourself, words almost cannot do it justice. This screen is unbelievably brilliant. Frickin' incredible. It's a bit wider and a tad shorter than my Palm but the display certainly looked 2 to 3 times brighter and way more clear. Off the charts a MUCH better screen. I have yet to see its equal. I cannot tell you how many times I went--out of habit--to grab the stylus in order to tap it on the screen only to realize my phone no longer has one. I hear rumor that RIM is coming out with a Bold-like phone with a keyboard and touch screen...now THAT will be a phone to look out for...but back to my Bold...I'll be honest, it is quite a change switching to an Operating System so dramatically different than the moronically simple one employed by Palm. Breaking old habits seem to be harder the older I get. Where Palm was intuitive and just plain obvious, Blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out. I chalk this up to my stubborness more than anything else...but the fact remains: the OS of my Blackberry suffers in comparison to how ridiculously easy Palm phones are to use and figure out. While I am STILL working on getting used to my phone, it DOES have some nifty features NOT found in any Palm device (yet)...for instance, the one thing that sets Blackberry's apart from EVERYTHING else out there is e-mail. This certainly is one place where the Bold not only beats Palm, but embarasses it entirely. The set-up was easy enough that even my Grandma could figure it out and within less than 10 minutes, I had 4 separate e-mail accounts up and running without a hitch. Too easy and it is definitely where the Bold shines (other than the screen).The trackball also takes some getting used to. It's nice that you can adjust the sensitivity of the ball, (much like using a mouse) so if you like to scroll quickly, you can, or if you'd like a bit more control, don't worry, you can do that, too. Another place where the Bold wins hands down is the speaker. It actually has TWO separate speakers which delivers actual stereo sound, quite loudly, I might add. Another really nifty thing if you ask me. It paired up with my Bluetooth quite easily and the sound quality from what those on the other end have told me is noticeably better than on my Palm (which was notorious for having Bluetooth issues).One thing I honestly wish Blackberry did differently is allow the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time. I always figured my wife just couldn't figure it out herself for why her's never did...but as it turns out the phone will vibrate first, and THEN ring. You cannot switch it to do both simultaneously...why, I simply have no clue. The addition of WiFi is a nice added bonus. At work I can surf using the wireless network at my office, also at home and at several friends houses out in the country where service is spotty. Another major advantage over Palm...although in fairness many newer Palms have built-in WiFi...but NONE of the models I have used ever did. 3G service is pretty nice, too...but my Treo 700p and 755p were both EVDO equipped, which are essentially the same thing, so no big difference there. Downloading websites and attachments via email online is a breeze.A couple places where Blackberry can take a cue from Palm (and I realize there aren't that many) are the lack of a switch on the outside that allows you to turn off the ringer instantly without using the screen. I also wish the button to turn on the speaker during a call was situated on the screen and activated via the trackball rather than having to push the tiny $ key on front...it just seems a bit harder to find, even in the dark with the backlight on. A small annoyance, but a valid one all the same.While I have heard many complain about the clarity of the camera, I gotta tell you its WAY better than the measly 1.3 mega-pixel standard on the Palms I've used. I snapped a photo of my little son and sent it to my wife's Blackberry Curve and she wrote back wondering where I had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone. Sure it'd be nice to have a 3.2 mp camera like on the Storm and 8900, but all in all I am satisfied--especially having come from the inferior Treo camera. The video recorder is noticeably of less quality than the camera is, which strikes me a little odd, but I don't usually videotape much using my phone, so I don't really see that to be a problem for me--but you never know.All in all, I gotta admit--and while it was a LONG time in coming, the Blackberry has won me over. The lack of almost ANY advance in the Palm OS over the course of over 10 years is pretty inexcusable if you ask me. Seriously, my original Palm organizer (no phone) looks relatively unchanged (other than color vs monochrome) from my old Treo 755p. Sure there are a few cosmetic changes in that time, but overall, the OS looks essentially exactly the same as it did from the beginning. That certainly made it easy to figure out when you upgraded over your previous model, but come ON...really? That is much too long to hold onto an outdated OS. The upcoming Pre certainly looks way cool and is an obvious 100% upgrade on the OS, but it just may be a little too late for some--it certainly was for me.If you are a die-hard Palm user frantically becoming disillusioned with your phone, its time to seriously consider moving on and putting the old away in exchange for something enirely new...just be prepared to take a while to get used to it...knowing that alone will make the conversion much easier to handle.Kudos to Blackberry on such a fine product. Conversion complete.*****UPDATE*****I am STILL working on getting used to Blackberry's entirely different Operating System. I find myself continually reaching for a stylus that isn't there, but I am slowly adjusting to a non-touch-screen phone (emphasis on s-l-o-w-l-y).The battery...? Well, let's just say as long as you have WiFi turned off, it's reasonably okay...which is to say on par with my Treo 755p...well, maybe a shade better, but not by much.The trackball...? Surfing on the Web using the trackball is MUCH less efficient than being able to use a stylus (or my finger). I find when I want to scroll down to the bottom of a particularly large page, it can seem like forever having to scroll down so slowly. I wish it were differently--and who knows? Maybe there is a work-around that I am unaware of...The e-mail set up and usage is simply FIRST RATE I have to admit. I haven't bothered to check my e-mail using my computer in several weeks now because I simply don't NEED to. I still send e-mail using my computer because even with the QWERTY keyboard, actually writing a message is still easier using a regular-sized keyboard...but I do find myself not even trying to access e-mail online much...thanks Bold!WiFi IS VERY convenient! The only minor gripe I have is that when I am in an area with less than stellar AT&T; coverage, I turn on WiFi and the phone STILL tries to use the almost non-existent signal to go online. I naturally assumed that the phone would use the strongest signal available, but as it turns out, that isn't the case. Now that I have that figured out, it's simply a case of figuring out where my signal strengths are and remember to turn off and on WiFi and phone receiver. Yes, it IS a bit of a problem, but my Alltel 755p had poor reception where my bedroom is and I was plain SOL if I wanted to check something online--at least NOW I have an option, however inconvenient it may be (I assure you, this is a minor gripe at best).The mp3 player is incredibly easy to use--unfortunately the built-in equalizer isn't all that great and the volume isn't quite what I'd like it to be--but seeing as I have managed to mis-place (lost) my Sansa Clip mp3 player, this is at least a nice alternative that otherwise wasn't available.I downloaded Transformers and Eagle Eye recently and I MUST say, this is yet one more place where the stunning screen simply SHINES beyond the competition. Add to that the fantastic stereo speakers, and watching feature-length movies in the palm of my hand couldn't be more cool & simple.I DO wish the button to turn on the speakerphone was a bit easier to locate and turn on...once again, adding a button to access the speaker ON the screen with the trackball, well that would be a giant leap forward for this device if you ask me.I am still finding it difficult to access a couple of books I downloaded using Mobi Pocket (ie I cannot access them at all), but otherwise, I am still impressed and VERY happy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Former Palm user Free @Last with Blackberry conversion", "unixReviewTime": 1240876800, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2009"}

Very handy way to charge without plugging and unplugging. Moreover, a handy feature (controlled by options you can choose on the phone settings) can automatically shift the Bold to clock mode when it is charging.

Or, it does charge, but then twenty minutes later it stops.  Easy to tell, because if it is not charging, it also does not shift into clock mode. So it sits in the pod, not charging. And because it isn't in clock mode it will ring if someone calls, not what you probably want in the middle of the night (especially if you are traveling and your caller does not realize the time zone you are in).  Somehow or another, the phone stopped connecting reliably to the dock.I am still using it, but instead of leaving the charger connected to the docking station, I plug and unplug the charger's cord from the phone itself each time, and use the docking station as just a stand.

I used the included Blackberry pouch for a 2 weeks while trying out different cases and also tried the Otterbox. In the end, I bought 3 of the Seidio cases in different colors I liked them so much.The rubberized material is soft, does not pick up much dust or lint and provides excellent grip overall. It's actually a hard plastic snap-on case that provides complete protection around the BB, minus the screen, keyboard, and ports. The Otterbox's cover picked up a lot of dust and lint. The Seidio has all the correct openings for the speakers, buttons, headphone jack, data/charging port, and LED. It only adds slightly more bulk to the phone while providing excellent protection against drops and scratches. The Otterbox was MUCH too bulky and the LED cut out did not align as well and so I could not see the blinking LED while the phone was laying flat. The Blackberry pouch was nice but I felt like I was going to drop it each time I tried to remove it. It was also hard to drive with because I'd either have to remove it from the case and have no protection while driving or leave it in the pouch and try to remove it when I needed to use it or view the screen.There are only few minor drawbacks to the case. First, it offers no protection for the screen. I remedied that by purchasing a screen protector from InvisibleShield. Second, there is a thin bar that runs over the Call/End buttons and trackball so scrolling up quickly is hindered. Lastly, I had to return two of these because they would not fit correctly over my BB. Of the 5 we purchased between my wife's BB and mine, we had to return 2. But once you get one that fits, it's great. Oh, it's also a little tough to remove the case but I recommend you stick your finger nail in between the top and bottom pieces at the bottom and running it from side-to-side to remove it.I have the burgundy, blue, and black cases for myself and my wife has just the black one.

The Innocase II is slim and adds very little to the size of the iPhone. It does not have a tacky feel at all and does not attract lint, but instead has a smooth, almost sensual feel, while still providing a good grip. I need to have my phone on my belt, but it would slide easily in and out of your pocket. It fits the phone perfectly and is tight enough that it has to be pushed on and is a little difficult to get off, so there's no worry about it coming off unless you want it to. It leaves the controls easy to reach and use, but protects them well enough that if you drop it, it would have to land at an angle on the controls to damage them. Not impossible, but it would have to land just right. It is also lined with a velvety material so it won't scratch your phone. I also like that it covers the silver bezel on the front of the phone. I'm sure some prefer to see it, but this case also protects that part. There is another brand that leaves that part exposed if you prefer that. With this case on, it's beautifully black sleek and sexy, like a beautiful woman wearing a little black dress.I haven't had any problems with the clips on the bottom portion, but I've only removed it about 3 times.The holster and Innocase were designed to work together and they do so perfectly. The Innocase clips easily and securely to the holster. It is also quick and easy to release when you want to use the phone. The Innocase goes into the holster with the screen facing the holster, so only the back of the case is exposed and the holster is also lined with the same material as the inside of the Innocase to protect the screen. Also, when you release the phone, it comes out in your hand in the right position for use, without having to maneuver, or turn the phone.I've never had a holster case before because I just didn't trust them, but bought this one based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. I've tried pulling the phone out of the holster and have been unable to get the phone to release from the holster unless I lift the catch. The belt clip has a hook at the bottom that attaches securely to my belt and is even a little difficult to pull off. It fits my heavy 1 1/2\" belt with no problem, but probably won't fit a belt much wider than that.The only problem I've had, if you can call it that, is that when the iPhone with the Innocase II is in the holster and on my belt, it's all so slim and light that I have to keep checking to make sure it's still there.If anything happens to this case I will definitely replace it and am thinking of getting another Innocase in a different color, just to have a spare.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Case", "unixReviewTime": 1247011200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2009"}

When I purchased my iPhone, my first concern was how to protect it from scratches.  The AT&T; employee was nice enough to install my first screen protector and I proceeded to buy a plastic holster from the ATT&T; store.  After using it a couple of days, I decided to return it as I'm sure the iPhone's back would either be scratched or even cracked without proper protection.  I decided to get a Contour Hybrid silicone/plastic case, which didn't last 2 months.  I wound up spending a week looking for a decent case and maybe even a holster if I could find one.  This lead me to Seidio Innocase II + Holster.  I read the reviews and was very impressed.  This combo was the only holster I found where you place the phone face in and uses a hard slider case.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and so far it's holding up pretty well.  The holster is very easy to use and can be operated with one hand.  The phone/case clips into place smoothly and stays clipped in securely.

The battery was finally starting to die; the expense of replacing the battery was about half the cost of the new CT14 so I figured I'd just get the new phone. The CT14 has some significant improvements to the earlier version.1) The big improvement is in sound quality. With the CT10, if you left the dial pad in the dock while on the phone, you'd hear clicking - something related to the charging circuit. This was particularly annoying because if the battery ran out during a long conference call, you had no choice but to leave the phone in the dock. With the CT14, there's no noise whether the dial pad is in the dock or not.2) The touchpad itself is improved. With the CT10, pushing a button sometimes resulted in a touchtone, but sometimes not. The CT14's dialpad is markedly improved. You still need very small fingers, so those with large fingers may have trouble pushing individual buttons. There's a screen on the CT14 dialpad too, another improvement, and it's backlit so as to be easily read in darkened environments.3) There is a choice of various ringtones and volumes, another nice improvement.4) The mute setting on the CT10 left you listening to a repetitive beeping sound. That was very annoying since muting usually means that you're trying to have another conversation during a conference call. Listening to beeping then isn't what you want. The CT14 doesn't have the beeps; rather you simply have a note on the screen telling you that you're muted. Excellent.5) The phone blinks to advise you that you have messages - this works well with a VoIP system. I use Vonage and the CT14 tells me if I have messages waiting.Range, comfort, etc., are all very good. It would be nice if we could eventually lose the wire between the headset and the dial pad since I'm always catching the wire on doorknobs and other items as I walk about while on the phone.

I loved it: it saved my neck from the pain associated with tilting my neck to hold a phone between my shoulder and my ear.  The sound quality was great.  The phone worked whether docked in its charger or while roaming the house.  The sound quality was exceptional.  the only problem I ever had with it was that I dropped it all the time and finally, after years of abuse, I killed it.  (In fact, I had two of these phones between 2000 and 2010, when I finally decided I couldn't squeeze anymore life out of the second one, also a victim of falls.)  Compared to the older models, this CT14 is a terrible disappointment.  I'm using it in the same location, yet now there is a constant irritating sound in the background.  And it cannot be used while docked in the charger.  May not sound like a big issue.  But to answer these phones, one has to get the headset on, then press the talk button before the call goes to voicemail.  With the old model, those were the only steps.  With the CT14, there is a 3rd step -- pull the phone out of the charger, get the headset on, then press talk.  It's not so easy to do that quickly, especially when the headset plug can pull out of the phone quite easily.  Also, if you're using the phone and inadvertently put it back in the charger because you're using it while sitting at the desk where the charger is, the phone disconnects the call.  If it does this because of some danger of the phone blowing up or giving me cancer while in use and in the charger, I'd be interested to know.  Otherwise, it just seems like a design flaw.  My rating of this phone is particularly low because I loved the older model so much.  It was a revalation.  This one is terrible by comparison.

Parties I've chatted with on the other side report generally good call quality, though this unit, unlike many corded headset amplifiers, does NOT provide the option to adjust your outgoing (read: microphone) volume. The voice quality is clear (thanks to the DECT 1.8GHz technology) -- and you won't pickup any of the interference common on the 2.4GHz band.

There are decent cordless phone systems, despite being larger, have a headset jack along with a standard handset and provide similar call quality -- at the same or lower price.I'm personally only using this with basic, metered rate phone service at home for LONG calls, so I have little use for the caller ID/voicemail options that are presented on the phone.

Power", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I bought this because plugging a headset into a standard cordless phone often results in the volume being too quiet.  Also less and less cordless phones are coming with the headphone jack.I've had this for a week now and am very impressed.  It sounds good on both ends, and is very loud.  It is so loud on my line that I actually wish the volume could be turned down even lower.  I'd rather that complaint than the opposite, which is more common.I have only used this phone with the headset that they supplied, so far, but it seems like you should be able to use any standard 1/8\" compatible headset with it.  I think that Platronics or Amazon should capitalize on that more, by recommending various headphones as \"accessories\" for this system.  If they sold a similar headset to the one supplied, but with two ear phones, I would probably buy that for conferences that I want to be more fully engaged in.  The option to use higher end 'noise reducing' headphones with this set would also be nice.The menu and keypad on this phone are intuitive, well laid out, and easy to use.  No complaints there.They seem to be marketing this phone for home use, although the 300 foot range is a little short for that purpose.  I am using it at my desk at work, and it is great in that environment.In summary:Strengths:+ good sound quality on both ends+ loud volume+ compact design+ good battery life+ industry standard headset jack+ easy to use+ adequate range for office use+ no interference with other devices (at my office)+ the range seems to be similar to other DECT 6.0 phonesAreas to improve:- Should capitalize on the standard headset jack by listing compatible accessory headsets.- Volume control does not go low enough- Can't be used in the base (hangs up if you put it in the base while talking which is an issue if the battery runs out during a long call).- It would be nice if they included a line splitter in the package.  Many people use this in addition to their desk phone.Overall, I like this a lot, and am even considering buying a second one for my house.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Simple, loud, easy to use, and works very well.", "unixReviewTime": 1343088000, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2012"}

Here is why, let me go through the good stuff and then the not so good stuff.The good=========+ Excellent sound quality - I've been using this for the last 3 weeks, never had call drops+ Light weight, compared to my Panasonic, this feels like feather+ Battery life that never seems to die - I have used it for almost upto 10 hours of talk time and all this in a tiny battery that fits inside !!+ Sturdy build - you can feel that the phone is sturdy, I accidentally dropped it on hard kitchen floor from 5 feet and it has survived without any damage.  My Panasonic would have given up, if not atleast the battery flaps would have come off+ Ergonomics - nice to hold, clip on to the belt (i usually keep it in my pocket)+ Good range - The wirless signals pretty strong, I could walk across the street and still be able to talk.  And unlike my panasonic - never did this phone fail to obtain a base connection within a reasonable range+ None/low interference with wireless networkThe bad=========If there is one big item that needs to improve in this phone - it is the user interface.  Plantronics really needs to make the phone a bit more friendlier to use.  But I also understand that Plantronics had to optimize on the space to make it smaller, but there are things which they can definitely improve on.- Difficult to nagivate/non-intuitive menu options- Not so friendly messages Example : '3 new CID' means '3 missed calls' !!!- Headset is great in sound, but not so good in the fit - I personally do not like the over the ear clip on head phones - why do not plantronics provide something simple like the one which iphone or blackberry provides.  Plantronics these cute bluetooth headphones (I have one) which are so small and nice - why did they not think of something like that.  Right now, I am using my blackberry headset which is simple and easy to use and carry and not look like a call center operator- Keys do not give a nice touch.  Keys are good, clear and sturdy, but you need to have the feel of clicking something with confidence, not a cushy rubber mat kind of feeling- No backlighting for keys - makes it hard sometimes to see in the dark- Lack of smart redialing - This applies to most of us who work from home offices: If you get on to a conference call, you typically dial a 1-800 number and then type in the conference id and passwordNow, when you hang up and redial - you just want only the 1800 number to be dialed, not the conference call id.  Most cell phones are smart enough to separate out the call number and redial, but this one is not equipped to redial just the phone number.Wish List=========- Wish it came with a speakerphone :)Value=========- Plantronics devices literally last for ever, I have used them in the past and they are so sturdy and well built that they will last atleast 10 years or more.But if you are looking at immediate value - the current price of $89 seems to be on the higher sideOverall - this is a great investment in a device which you will be using on a daily basis.  Work from home, small business owners or just anyone else who needs to be on a phone while working will need this - with the kind of battery life that this device packs - you could literally talk the entire work day  and never worry about recharging", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good sound quality, long battery life, not so good user interface", "unixReviewTime": 1255392000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2009"}

I have tried several cases and this is my favorite.I call it minimal. There is not much protection from dropping. The benefit I see is the textured surface that provides a better grip, helping to keep you from dropping it in the first place. (I think most cases, except the bulky ones, do not provide much protection from dropping anyway.)The Apple logo and chrome trim remain visible. Among the cases I have used and seen, it best preserves the distinctive appearance of the iPhone 3G (at least, the black model).It is not compatible with my iPhone 3G docking adapters, and I expected that. It would be nice if there were a flip hinge on the bottom to accommodate docking adapters. Because it does not completely wrap around the edges of the phone, it is not too hard to take off and put back on. I get a little nervous, though, because in the process of removing it, it scrapes on the seam between the chrome and black plastic (at least the way I do it). I do not want to pull to hard on that seam, to avoid potential separation problems (light leakage, etc. as reported sometimes on Apple support forums).One complaint is when I use it with one hand. In doing so, I rest the phone on my little finger while texting with my thumb. There is a sharp edge at the bottom of the case that digs into my finger after a few minutes, making it uncomfortable. I think with a minor modification with a small file, I may be able to smooth that down. The case appears to be made of painted white plastic, however, so I have to be careful not to spoil the appearance too much.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A good, minimal case", "unixReviewTime": 1234828800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2009"}

While it will just fit a Galaxy S3 or S4 with an Otterbox Prefix hybrid cover, it will NOT accept either handset fitted with an Otterbox Defender, LifeProof FRE, or Survivor. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list; and I haven't tried it with an Otterbox Commuter, so I can't say, one way or the other.It is extremely well made from polyurethane with leather like grain, a soft fiber inner lining, a magnetic locking flap, and a STRONG, rotating belt clip that fastens tightly and securely to your belt, waistband, or bag. I should mention here that the case I received differs slightly from that in the listing photo. Mine has elastic sewn into the side panels, and lacks the silly looking \"Apophis\" serpent logo. Most importantly, it does NOT bleed black dye onto my phone, unlike the item some reviewers have mentioned!I bought mine right here from Amazon seller \"DeCi Accessories\". They shipped almost immediately, provided a USPS tracking number, and it arrived ahead of schedule. I'm very pleased with mine, and recommend it highly for those who prefer a slim and elegant carry pouch to massive, bomb proof enclosures. At this price, I'm even ordering a \"spare\" while they're still available.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just right for Galaxy S3, S4 with TPU cover!", "unixReviewTime": 1390435200, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2014"}

I just received it in the mail this week and at when I first installed it I was a little dissapointed.  The silver bevel around the phone protrudes from the case slightly (approximately 1 mm) all the way around the case.  At first I thought it may have just been a bad case, but I looked at someone elses phone that has the same case and theirs is the same way.  This was a slight annoyance but other than this small detail the phone is perfect to me.I read another review that mentioned that the volume controls were recessed too far for their liking, in my opinion it is perfect and gives you the sense that the volume controls are a little better protected in the event of a drop.The case itself has a nice feel to it and has a soft matte like finish.The screen protectors that are included are of good quality.  However, I am still partial to the anti-reflective protectors (the ones from Power Supply are the best that I have found).Previously my favorite cases were the \"Flick\" but it was very shiny and showed too many scratches, and the Case Crown case with the matte finish, but the Case Crown case broke fairly quickly (one of the corner \"brackets\" popped off).  The Case Crown also allowed a lot of sand/lint etc. to get between the case and the phone.  Now the \"Feather\" case by Incipio is currently my case of choice....

I have never dropped or abused the case, but now i have three cracks (two of which have cut all the way through, making the plastic come apart) at the top of the case, one near the headphone jack, and one near the on/off button. I really liked the case, but i guess it's not built to last. My best guess as to how it happened is that over time, when you take the phone out of your pocket or something similar, the plastic catches, and it stresses the case. Once you get a crack (i had the crack near the on/off button first) it's just a matter of time before you get another one as the crack will open the case up to getting \"caught\" on something more often. It's not possible to fix with adhesives (i tried); it may appear to be holding, but because the case is so tight when you put it on the phone, the fixed crack will open up again during the process.It's really too bad... i was really hoping it would last longer.---If you're looking for a case that will protect against scratches from everyday use (putting the phone on the table, for example) this is the case to get. It's light, sturdy and has got a nice feel, with minimalist design so it's not changing the look of the phone. If you're a total clutz and need a case that will protect against multiple drops, and you're the type who doesn't know whether the phone is up or facing down when you set it down on hard surfaces, this is not the case for you. In fact, any case that can take that kind of abuse will not look nice on ANY phone, so you should curb your expectations in that regard.As with ANY case, you're gonna get discoloration and wear over time, so to minimize this effect i would suggest getting darker color cases - and stay away from any shiny or clear finishes. I got the flat black colored case and scratches are not noticeable and i can use my phone without having to worry about whether i'm gonna scratch the case badly or not. After all, they're meant to take the scratches so i don't understand people that complain about why protective cases get scratched up.Anyways, product is solid. It also comes with a protective film - i would recommend watching instructional videos on youtube on how to apply them as you only get one try with this package (i messed up and had to get another, poorer film product).

The one I received from Amazon looked almost identical to my old case, but has major quality issues- the matte finish coating started peeling off almost instantly. In fact, it peels off by simply scratching the case with a fingernail, revealing a glossy plastic base.Which leads me to believe it's either-1.

I've seen several people that had the snug, rubber-type case for their iPhone.  Many complained about trying to get the phone out of their pocket, the rubber case doesn't slide out nicely, it tends to 'stick'.The Incipio case fits snugly around the iPhone and doesn't cover the silver bezel in the front of the phone.  It's sturdy, very well made, and fits perfectly around the camera, volume, mute, and charger areas.  It simply looks like a second skin, matte black.  The plastic Incipio uses doesn't scratch easily (I've had mine for almost a month of constant use and don't have one scratch on it) and the edges are nicely rounded so your fingers slide over it smoothly.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is I don't like the logo on the back.  They make a great case and then put their logo in white letters on the back.  It's not gaudy, I just don't like it.  It should be more subtle, muted.Overall, the case is everything I was looking for in a simple, elegant, smooth case.UPDATE: In December, 2010, I accidentally broke this case by trying to remove my iPhone.  I had not removed the iPhone for several months and I think it was 'stuck' in the case.  While trying to remove the phone, I broke the small, thin section near the volume control buttons.

To get around this you must have all your email forwarded to a service like Hotmail or Yahoo, which means you will get copies of your email immediately. However, if you want to reply, you will not be able to change your reply-from account from Hotmail to your main ISP email provider. You'll have to wait 15 minutes until the original email comes through.When you are in a call, the screen goes dark quickly, and it requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to press keys during your call or even if you want to switch to speaker phone mode.Trying to type an email or text takes real perseverance. The default \"Sure Type\" mode that suggests words is cumbersome, and changing its suggestions can be maddening. Even in landscape mode with a QWERTY keyboard, an auto-correct feature takes over and requires constant vigilance. And just TRY to use the touch-and-click screen to reposition the insertion point and make a correction several letters or words back; it's really frustrating.The manual that comes with the phone and the various online tutorials don't begin to cover what you need to know to use the phone's features; you will need to attend a Verizon workshop.All of the above assumes that phone actually works as it's supposed to. After spending hours with Verizon and BlackBerry support staff, I finally got the phone to the point where it works much of the time, which is a giant step up from the way the phone came out of the box.Here are some of the problems, all of which BlackBerry acknowledges as \"known issues\" and which Verizon will tell you SHOULD be addressed in a long-promised and long-overdue software upgrade (think Windows Vista):* Voice-command dialing (e.g., via Bluetooth headset) sometimes results in a white screen that locks up your phone and requires one or more reboots (a reboot means removing the battery for 15 seconds, replacing it, and waiting 4 to 6 minutes until you can use the phone again).* The battery drains quickly and sometimes continues to drain when plugged into a charger; it may require one or more reboots to start charging.* Synching the Storm with Outlook can result in errors that prevent this feature from working until you spend many hours with support staff trying to find which record causes the problem; the fix will last a couple of days, before the problem recurs.* The network connection turns itself off occasionally, and you won't be able to make or receive calls until you notice that the network is off and you go into the options to turn it back on.In order to get around the Bluetooth lock-ups, I purchased aBlackBerry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset, which the manual recommends. It has cut down on, but not eliminated, the number of lock-ups.The most helpful support person was a Verizon tech who had me \"wipe\" the phone and start over (choose the \"Options\" button, then \"Security Options,\" then \"General Settings,\" then press the menu button and choose \"Wipe Handheld\"; all the software reloads automatically, but you will have to reload any personal data). That helped with most of the problems, including the Outlook synch problem, which hasn't recurred (it's been 10 days).", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Too many problems", "unixReviewTime": 1241308800, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2009"}

As a web browser and general all-around application tool, the Storm is far superior to the Bold (and the Curve) due to it's large touch screen. As a mail READER, the Storm is also superior.As alluded to by numerous other reviewers, the only non-superior aspect of the device is the maximum speed at which a user can type out a message. For generating email & text, a traditional quality keyboard such as on the Curve (and to a lessor extent the Bold) will actualize your maximum typing speed... if that's what's most important to you.For me, the ease of navigating screens and applications (to include READING email) via the touch screen is far more important than maximum typing speed (I have an office computer and a notebook with broadband; either of which I will use to generate most of my wordy emails. I use the blackberry mostly to keep abreast of what's going on while away from those primary computing tools). Using the trackball of the Bold and the Curve is much more cumbersome for the regular away from desk tasks of reading email, browsing the web, updating Twitter, etc.There is also currently a socio-capitalistic elitism to be enjoyed by having the touch screen of the Storm (sure, deny it if you want, and hate me for bringing it up, but you know in your heart that like me, you enjoy having the coolest new toy in the office, and this is it!).Summary: I read 30 email messages a day on my phone, but only respond or generate a few... the keyboard's maximum typing speed is of secondary concern for you if you share my same use model (and the web browsing on the Storm, like the iPhone, is absolutely joyous!)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great solution for those with moderate email creation & response needs", "unixReviewTime": 1231632000, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2009"}

Maybe RIM should give you the option to turn clicking off so u can use it like any old touch screen.The device actually has gaps between the screen and the rest of the body, allowing dust and dirt to get into your phone!

I use mac, own several of ipods..etc, but when it comes to mobile phone use, I just couldn't give up using a bberry(coming from Curve & pearl).  ( I played around with iPhone for a month but it really wasn't any different than ipod touch that I had because the phone was pretty much useless with all the dropped calls)With the Storm, I'm no longer require to carry a business phone, personal phone, ipod or a portable DVD player.About the only \"con\" I can think of about the storm is that, I can not type as fast as I used to on the Curve.( but then again, I don't think i can type as fast on any touch screen phone)also, the plug is micro USB instead of miniUSB.  which mean I can no longer use the car charger from my other bberries/or motorola chargers...MotoQ or razr.By no means, this is a perfect phone.  It has it's imperfactions.  But then again, other winMO, treo or iphone have their share of short comings or faults as well.  Yes, storm does freeze, resets once in awhile(which seemed to have stopped with OS upgrade).  But to me this really isn't a \"con\" as seeing that every other phone out there will all freeze/reset occasionally.  That's just a nature of electronics.  I mean, have you owned a smartphone/mac/PC that didn't freeze or stall on you once in awhile(ctrl+alt+Del)??Having few months under my belt, I can say that lot of the problems people have addressed in their reviews are fixable with OS upgrade and/or by having settings set correctly.  I've been an early adapter for phones like MOTO Q, Treos, and iPhone.  Compared to those phones, I think RIM is coming along just fine as far as working out the kinks and having bugs fixed thru OS updates.  Even the iphone fanboys have to admit, it took them almost a year before iphone became where it's at current state.Now to some things I like about this phone.- Verizon network coverage..  Call quality is superb as usual just like all of my past Bberries.  not 1 dropped call.(might be a RIM hardware thing, cuz my Moto Q used to drop calls once in awhile)**set aside all the bells and whistles, this should be your most important factor in choosing a phone.  I'm not suggesting Verizon has best coverage in your area..  I'm sure there are areas verizon lacks coverage where others excel at.- instant email & Blackberry Messenger  (2 things that no other phones can compare/compete with and what makes it my \"crackberry\")- being able to use AIM, Yahoo MSGer, google talk all simultaneously  (waiting on Jivetalk to come out with  the update, which will enable me to use 1 program for all IM programs)- visual voice mail(being able to check vmail without having to call in...shows lengh of msg, who it's from..etc before you even check the actual message)- shooting videos, being able to upload online(eg. youtube) rightaway, or sending via MMS- takes great quality of photos (easy upload to flkr, facebook..etc)- using Trapster, getting warnings about upcoming speedtraps, camera lights is a lifesaver($$$ saver too)- streaming online radios (Moodio, flycast..etc)- Being able to wirelessly sync(google sync) contacts, calendar with Google acct.- Full fuctional GPS with 3rd party apps.  (trapster, Nav4all..etc)- Full HTML browsings  (if BB browser doesn't do it for you, check out BOLT browser)- being able to just drag&drop; movies, songs, ringtones, pics straight into storm without 3rd party app. (both on Mac and PC) you can use it like a flash Drive or external Hard Drive.- Great Media player  (viewing photos, music, Video)  Watching a full length movie on the storm is amazing.  Really no other phone out there can compare to quality of this screen  except maybe Blackberry BOLD.- Being able to listen to music/movie via bluetooth headset/speaker or having it piped thru my car stereo via bluetooth using (Motorokr T505)- not sure what other documents it can open/view, but I was able to open MS word, Excel, Powerpoint slide show, & Adobe PDF files no problems on storm.- being able to tether via bluetooth to use as wireless modem for my laptop.- Being able to changeout batteries and micro SD card.  (Those long plane rides are not so long anymore with 2 extra batteries and a extra 16GB cards along with 8GB card that came with the phone)*I covert my DVD's to 600-700MB sized file, so you can imagine how many movies I can carry on a 16GB card.-being able to Multitask.  eg. I can listen to streaming radio while my AIM is online in the backgroud and I'm checking my email.- Being able to have it \"Unlocked\" - took me about 5 mins with Vzw rep to have my phone SIM unlocked.  This means, even though it is a CDMA phone here in US, when I travel overseas, I can just pop in a pre-paid GSM SIM card from that country without having to pay for roaming fees(this makes a truly world phone for me).  I did test with my buddy's AT&T;, T-Mo simcard to make test calls/txts and it worked flawlessly.**I'm not saying other phones aren't capable of these things.

Bellin \"analog_j\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "This is the best, most useful phone I have ever encountered overall.First of all, while I always prefer a phone with a real, rather than virtual QWERTY keyboard, the click-touch interface at least gives a tactile response to the user.  This interface also helps distinguish between merely selecting (highlighting) something and commanding an execution.  One of the great things about this interface is that it uses the type of contact used in the IPhone, where the device recognizes you with a mere laying of your finger onto the screen.  Having previously used a Voyager which requires a physical push of the screen to recognize anything, this electrical type of interface is much easier.  Unlike the push touchscreens which have a hard time discerning between merely selecting and executing a command, the fact that Research in Motion added a clickable aspect to the screen makes entering commands easier and more clear.  By the way, even the IPhone can have that problem as it has to recognize a mere placement or swipe of the screen (highlighting) and a tap (executing a command). There are those who feel that the clickable screen slows down texting.  Yes, that will be true compared to a real QWERTY or the IPhone's keyboards, but less mistakes will be made on this virtual keyboard.  When selecting a link on a web page, for instance, you merely slide your finger over the screen until you get to the link you wish to click on, then push down with a click and you're where you want to go.Speaking of the browser, it's quite quick (The new IPhone also has a WiFi option, which IS really quick, and that's what you're using when you're in an Apple store.).  On top of that, there's something pretty great with the Storm I have not seen on other phones (just to say that I may not be aware of any, not that there aren't).  You can set the internet browser to appear to the web page you land on as either a Blackberry mobile device or appear to the page as either a Firefox or Internet Explorer browser.  Why is this important?  Some sights work better with Internet Explorer or Firefox browsers.  Sometimes, you don't want to get the webpage's mobile site.  For example, The Boston Globe's mobile website,[...], is very limited.  When I go there, I usually switch from the Blackberry mobile browser to either Firefox or Internet Explorer where I can get the full website.  This phone has no problem with most full websites.  I have encountered sites where you need to put in a user name and password and find that the full browser works better.This phone has an accelerometer.  I'm not sure HOW they work, but, like the IPhone, it automatically changes its orientation depending on how you hold it. If you hold it vertically, it gives you a vertical orientation, etc.There are so many features built into the phone, including a GPS, which will map any area and provide directions, but no voice help.  For that, you can use the Verizon VZNavigator, but that's an extra charge.  The media player can play many types of music files including straight .wav files (which is the file type used on CDs, so you get the same quality sound you get from your CDs.).  Most players can only play the very compressed .mp3 files.  You don't even need special software to download files from your computer (though the Blackberry comes with a few programs to help you do this).  Simply connect the Blackberry to your computer, then drop and drag the files you want from your computer to the Blackberry drive using Windows Explorer.The phone can multi-task.  There is a task manager, which allows you to switch between open applications without closing them.The screen itself is pretty spectacular and the phone comes with a preview to a film just to show you how much it's capable of.  While most downloaded files are not of great quality, I have streamed .mp4s and they show up quite sharp.The built in 3.2mp camera is sharp, but not spectacular.  It's color correction is not adjusted as well as it could be, but overall it ain't bad.  There is a built-in flash.There are lots and lots of applications now available for the Storm, and they take advantage of the power and screen quality of the device, including a dedicated YouTube interface.  There is a Prodigy for Blackberry.  This was really Blackberry's attempts at rivaling the IPhone for sure.  Someone said to me that this is an IPhone for business people.Here's the downside to the phone and it's why I haven't given it 5 stars.  The documentation for users stinks.  A lot of this capability I only found through  trial and error or talking with either Verizon's own Blackberry service (they have a separate group that handles Blackberry only) and Blackberry's own people.  Comparing Verizon's literature that came with the Voyager and other phones I have used which talked about the littlest minutiae, Blackberry's documentation leaves a lot to be desired.  Thank goodness I'm pretty intuitive in this area and I know to poke around.  Still, there are things I would have liked to know from the documentation that are fairly basic.I'll cite just a few examples:You like that one can drop and drag files directly into the Blackberry Storm by using Windows Explorer?  Nothing in the documentation on that.  I found discovered this while talking to one of the RIM guys up in Canada.Want to customize your screen to eliminate icons of programs you won't use?  Or how 'bout how to customize the \"desktop\" of your phone?  Well, there's nothing in the documentation -- not in the booklet accompanying the phone, nor on the accompanying the CD, nor online.  I went to the Blackberry website and did a search from the front page. I put in \"icon\" into the search.  The only thing that came up were pages on how to create your own icons.  Again, a tech was able to explain how to do this.Third example:  When using the camera, there are several icons or numbers across the lower camera screen.  Some of them are obvious, some are curious and one, as it turns out, isn't used (the designers intially put it in and then opted not to use it, though it wasn't removed entirely).  There is NO explanation in the documentation as to what each of the icons or numbers represent.  Contrast this to the Voyager's documentation which explains each and every button and visual.  No stone unturned in that documentation.  Yes, the flash can be turned on automatic mode, off mode or forced mode, but is there anything that mentions this?  No.4th example:  That wonderful feature allowing you to switch browser-type I mention above?  I only learned about this by talking to one of the techs when I was having trouble working on a website.  Again, there is nothing in the accompanying documentation about this.So, there is a myriad of ways to customize the phone in terms of its functionality (not so much visually).  Most of these are found by using the Blackberry's menu button.  Unfortunately, some things you want to alter may need to be altered while in the application and others from the home screen.  You'll have to learn which are which strictly through trial and error.Contrast this to the IPhone.  Apple has mastered user intuitiveness.  The IPhone's interface is so obvious, at least to me.  I hardly needed to know the phone to know how to use it and how to get where I wanted to go.  The IPhone does have an open platform so many designers are coming up with apps for it.  The interface is quite elegant.  The home screen is simple and then drilling down is intuitive.But I can download files of all types and attach them in emails using the Blackberry.  An Apple rep told me that someone is working on a application which will allow downloading of files and attachment to emails.  When that happens, I'll consider it.  And while Blackberry's monthly fee is higher than Verizon's, it comes with unlimited data AND video and picture messaging, and I believe, the fee is less than AT&Ts; monthly fee.Bottom line here -- the Storm is INCREDIBLY capable.  The user interface just isn't as elegant or intuitive for the non-computer type users.  If you can be patient, and will to make a few phone calls to the techs (Clearly, they value Blackberry users business, as you get right through, no waits and all from US call centers.), once you have learned the quirks (the learning curve on this is much higher than on the IPhone), it's a wonderful and very useful phone.  The up and coming Storm 2 will apparently include WiFi (useful), but may not have the click screen (I, personally, would miss this feature, but I understand it can slow down the person who is a fast text message wiz.).I'm curious about the new Droid phone Verizon is touting.  I stick with Verizon.

In fact, my prior LG clamshell phone was a better phone in terms of handling, use and overall experience. But the Storm was not designed to be merely a phone, and I didn't buy it for that purpose. The Storm is a multimedia device, and after having the phone for three weeks now, I can say that I had my doubts, but am now satisfied and intend to keep the phone. I did my homework on new phones and went with the Storm once the Blackberry App World received glowing reviews within days of its launch on April 1, 2009. There is a learning curve with the Storm, but once you learn how the device works, it can be a useful and functional computer in your pocket. Many reviews complain about how buggy and slow the phone can be (and prior models and OS were apparently), but I have learned that the key to optimum performance for the Storm is managing the application memory. Close all applications properly, do an occasional battery pull (or get a free app to simulate one) and learn a few other tricks and you can have a wide-range multimedia device on a network faster than AT&T.; Pandora is now available for free through the App World, which, as a music lover, is worth quite a bit to me. Not to mention the ability to take pictures with the Storm's 3.2 mp camera and upload them on my Flickr account within seconds. Like I said - a multimedia device.The instruction manual Verizon provides with the phone is virtually useless for anyone vaguely familiar with how a Blackberry works. But with an investment of time online at [...] and a few other sites you too can unleash the Storm's full potential.

I must admit that if Verizon had the iPhone I might have chosen it over this (at least until RIM releases a software patch or two). But as it is AT&T; service is horrible, so the iPhone os not an option for me and those who prefer Verizon's service. If you want to stay with Verizon this is a great phone. Let me give a run down of its pros and cons.PROS:-It has great reception (the most important feature seeing as its a phone).-Its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-Decent internet speed, even indoors.-Good MP3 and video playing capabilities, on par with the iPhone I tried.-A great camera as far as phones go. Obviously not a replacement for a stand alone camera, but no phone camera is.-Unlike my old Curve you can use the built in GPS without paying for VZNavigator.-Bright, clear screen that is much better looking than the iPhone I tried.-Sleek look.-Its a Blackberry, previous and current BB users will find a lot of familier features here.-Does not require iTunes, but it supports it if you wish to use it.CONS:-Its slow. It often freezes while doing the simplest things like turning or switching menus. On the bright side this seems like it could be fixed with a software upgrade.-Its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-Like the iPhone (and any other touchscreen phone), the on screen keyboard can take some getting used to. In this case the SureType feature in particular.-Typicall early adobter syndrom. If you buy this you know that it is likely an improved version will be released in a year or two. Also as of right now accessories are hard to come by along with apps taylored to the Storm (luckely most Blackberry aps work on it). The last two issues will likely dissapear when the stores stock more accessories and the App Store launches next year (along with more 3rd parties supporting the Storm).All in all I'd say if you want a an iPhone, without switching to AT&T; and their lousy service you won't regret getting a Storm. I love it, and its likely to only get better through software updates. As for the price its basically $30 or $45 (depending on whether you need/want corperate e-mail or not) on top of your regular Voice plan charges, as is the case with all Blackberry devices.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great iPhone alternative for Verizon users.", "unixReviewTime": 1227830400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2008"}

But that's because I'm open minded about these types of things.  Was the thing overhyped?  Probably.  But so what?  Methinks too many people get their hopes up and expect the world when they should understand by now that NO technology is ever perfect.First of all, to those that wonder if BlackBerry has lost its touch (no pun intended), wonder no more.  Internally this is a BlackBerry, through and through.  The only real distinction between this and other BlackBerries is the screen/navigation, period.  It's still the champion of email and messages; still handles documents, still handles PDFs, still is one of the best all around communication devices there is.  In fact, behind the the pretty interface, the apps are nearly identical to that found on the Curve or Pearl.As you've likely noticed already, this device has been getting either lauded...or blasted...depending on who you talk to.  Some reviewers love it, some hate it.  99% of reviews compare it to iPhone (AT&T;), simply because of the touch screens and accelerometer.  But to be truthfully frank, that's really where the similarities end, and is the background of my review here, as I've not used an iPhone and therefore make no comparisons.  I did own an iPod Touch for about a day (returned it, couldn't stand it), so I'm familiar with some of the touch functionality found there, but ultimately I didn't get the BB for its touch; I got it because it's a BlackBerry.  If you're in the same boat, read on.As I mentioned, this has all of the functionality of the other BlackBerries.  Email on the go is the #1 feature for me and the reason I keep coming back to BlackBerry, and this one is just as good as the others, if not better.  Of notable mention is the new method of navigation on this phone; there's no scroll wheel, no \"pearl\" to scroll through options.  There are two ways to navigate: touch, and click.  Touch selects an option (referred to as \"highlighting\"), which click activates it.  This is important, because it means you can't use touch to type.  You have to use click for each key.  Some don't really care for this. Part of that is RIM's fault, because of the way they presented this functionality.  They made it seem as though the screen was some sort of soft press deal that \"felt\" like keys...when really it's a single dimple pressing a single button to activate whatever option is highlighted.  You can hopefully see where I'm going with this and why I said it that way.Sometimes you'll highlight an option not what you want, thinking you're on something else, and when you click, it will do the option you didn't want.  So for example, you'll be on a menu option attempting to close an application, and it does \"Switch Application\" instead.  You'll see \"Close\" clearly highlighted, but it does the other one.  You didn't see where the highlight shifted at the last minute.  It happens.  The reason this happens is due to the user and the adjustment period to getting used to the device.  You really need to take your time and pay attention to what's being selected; it's not like other BlackBerries where you can feel out certain options, or like some users who can select options with their eyes closed because they're just that good at the navigation.  It's just a learning curve, but one that not everyone will tolerate.I had a co-worker ask me what kind of person would enjoy this device.  It's hard to say.  What I know for certain is that if you're not a \"gadget head\", you probably won't like it.  If you're the kind of person who just needs to make calls this is not the device for you.  That's not to say it's not good at making and receiving calls, because it is...better than most other phones I've had.  It's just that, if that's all you care to do, this phone is overkill.  Same for the Sidekick/LG Voyager/Dare converts; in my opinion, this phone is way overkill.What some have to understand, is that BlackBerries are business phones.  They are designed for the business-minded individuals who need to get stuff done.  Certainly RIM has gone out of its way to \"consumerize\" the device, but at the end of the day, it's not going to have a stellar, if any, camera.  It's not going to be the ultimate media player.  It's not going to be the ultimate instant messaging machine.  But it will get stuff done efficiently.Another co-worker approached me after having bought the Storm, on the verge of returning it due to multiple frustrations with using the device.  His #1 complaint: too confusing how to figure out how to do everything.  I countered this by explaining that the main difference between iPhone and Storm is that the iPhone wants to hold your hand through the process.  It wants to \"teach\" you how to use it effectively.  The Storm, on the other hand, is still a BlackBerry at heart.  BlackBerries don't \"teach\".  They expect you to know how to do the basics already.  This can be considered a shortcoming on RIM's part, but to their credit they do run you through a setup the first time to try and help you learn the basics; quite honestly, you'll only learn by doing it and patiently working with the phone.Another concern people have, and have had since the Pearl, is with SureType, complaining that it's difficult to use.  SureType is actually more intelligent than the regular phone predictive text engines; What some miss, and the reason they get frustrated with it, is that SureType is also attempting to think for you.  There are a lot of things it will do for you without you even realizing it.  Basic things such as punctuation, first letter capitalization, etc. are all done by SureType automatically.  The best way to use SureType: don't think too hard about what's going on the screen; just spell out the words, space, period.  Repeat that, without worrying about what's happening on screen (for the most part).  If you let SureType handle the logic behind the sentence structure, you'll probably find that it's even easier to manage than standard QWERTY, even though QWERTY does some of the same things.  If you think/worry too hard about what SureType is doing, it's guaranteed to give you errors, because you're effectively fighting the engine without even realizing it.Finally, make sure you update your phone to the latest firmware as soon as you get it, as it will resolve a lot of the issues with the screen navigation and accelerometer.  Other than that there isn't really much else I can say.  Either you will like it, or you won't.

As intrigued as I am by the iPhone and the huge application offering, the Storm is still king in the smartphone arena. I won't give up my iPod touch anytime soon though!I've had a couple Blackberry products, so by no means am I new convert to Blackberrys. I upgraded to the Storm and received it the Saturday after released. Friends waited in line on release day for many hours, and in all honesty, it only ended up being 12-16 hours later that I got mine from Fed-Ex by the time they made it out of the stores.Out of the box, the operating system (OS) was by no means stunning. It is a good looking phone though! Shortly after the release and the problems of typing and rotation issues, the beta OS'es were hitting the web. These made for HUGE improvements in the functionality of the phone. The downside is that RIM/Verizon is SLOW to release an approved version. The current release is still .75 which fixed all the initial huge problems. All phones are delivered with .75 today. I just completed the installation of .141 this morning, which is rumored (aren't they all?) to be what will be the next official release. I have my doubts, but it is huge improvement over many of the previous beta releases I was running.The memory leaks are FINALLY gone (went away for me with .132). I am running with ~40mb of free memory, and it stays there! Before I moved to the previous beta release of .132 I had to reboot the phone daily because of memory leaks. The upgrade to .142 gave me about 8mb additional free memory.A pointer like box was added in recent beta releases which makes corrections much easier when composing an email.As strange as it may sound, typing has been consistently getting better with the OS updates. I didn't think that this would be possible, thought it was a problem with the implementation of the touch screen.A nice drop in dash mount for my leather Piehl case has also allowed me to replace my Garmin GPS. I chose the Verizon Navigation software as it is discounted through my corporate discount plan, and most importantly traffic is offered in my area. The Garmin BB software didn't offer a manual route around detours which was a problem where there isn't traffic coverage and you are notified of a road closure.The application offering is ever expanding, my favorite of which is Pandora. That replaced my Sirius subscription, and best of all, it is free.The camera isn't half bad for a cell phone, this again has been improved with newer beta releases. Geotagged pictures are pretty neat as I have a pro Flickr account which has built in integration to the phone.&lt;update 5-13-09>I downgraded from the 142 release, and since installed a Hybrid OS running leaked version 141 and a beta of the upcoming 5.0 base OS update. We're in for big things. The 5.0 Bold platform browser which is coming to the Storm is a huge leap forward. The browser is SO much faster under 5.0.Memory utilization is vastly improved as well. I hang in the mid 40mb free range. Mind you the OS shipped on the phone will be less than 10mb and require daily reboots (battery pull unless you get an application-free to do a true reset).Version 141 was rumored to be the next official VZW approved release OS, but it didn't pass QA. I do have a Bluetooth stack issue under 141 where BT cuts out from my S9 headphones after every song. It does the same thing when connected to Bluetooth in my car.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Blackberry - this isn't a toy like the iPhone", "unixReviewTime": 1241049600, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2009"}

{"reviewerID": "A2YM85TO0H2JET", "asin": "B001HSMHGO", "reviewerName": "D. Emerson", "helpful": [38, 38], "reviewText": "I'll just list out the aspects of the phone.  More convenient that way.-Touchscreen: Not as responsive nor as user-friendly and intuitive as the iPhone, but definitely usable, stylus (which is provided), and finger-wise. Sharp, bright colors, with an auto-adjust function that works amazingly well, even in bright sunlight. Slightly recessed, so it does collect dust and other debris (which I found surprisingly annoying, since even lint easily picks up from my pocket), but overall, very attractive and usable.-Windows Mobile 6.1: Though there are still some bugs, a marked improvement over the last version.  The one really annoying aspect of the system is still the slow loading time, and the main nagging thing I noted is that there's a HUGE lag after text messaging, after the message informing you that the text was sent.  The system freezes for a good 5-10 seconds, and won't let you do anything during that time frame.  Mostly just annoying, though certainly not a detractor, especially if you don't text a whole lot.-The keyboard: Spacious, despite the compactness, and slightly curved, with an assisted spring mechanism that feel very, very solid.  The one qualm I have is that they keys are nearly flush with the tray, and the top row can be difficult to press, since it's nearly flush beneath the screen.  Other than that, with some use, it's easy to get used to, and doesn't add bulk or awkward feeling to the phone, like some full QWERTY keyboards. The keys are also backlit, which is a nice touch, especially in shadowed or darkened areas.-The keys: There's plenty of softkeys and shortcuts available, and they're very well-suited for the phone.  There's an optical joystick (passing your finger over the surface allows you to scroll without physically pressing the top/bottom keys, or the screen), which also serves as an \"OK\" key.  I really liked that addition to the phone, since I'm not a big trackball fan, and the sensitivity is customizable, since a too sensitive setting can sometimes lead to wrong commands. There's a dedicated panel key, which is somewhat like a home-screen key, since it takes you to the main panel selection every time. There are also dedicated phone keys, a toggle on the side for volume, and a power/sleep button on the top.  They don't detract from the phone, and the only sticking point is that they're sometimes a bit stiff to press.  Other than that, it's a nice, somewhat comforting feeling to have dedicated keys available, unlike the iPhone.-The panels: These have been touted as, and are, really, the main attraction of the phone. They're are an interesting, very positive feature, since they're customizable (you can even move them around, though this has to be done through choosing a panel and editing it, instead of just dragging it across the screen, which would have been much more intuitive), and varied, and give the Windows system a more personal feel. They can be a bit laggy, but they're fun and functional (the fish panel is just amusing, with the ability of the fish to change color, follow the touch, or swim away if pressed), though I've yet to find a use for the Google page, since it always defaults to Internet Explorer, which I don't utilize.-Internet browsing: Pretty snappy and speedy, even on the Edge network.  The area in which I live doesn't support the 3G bands on this particular phone (I have the overseas Xi, while the U.S. will ship the Xia), though bigger cities with the 1900mHz towers do.  I don't use Internet Explorer, since it's still one of the most useless and dated mobile browsers out there.  The phone is shipped with Opera Mobile 9.5 installed, which works similarly to Safari on the iPhone, though thankfully the cut and paste options are available, unlike the iPhone.  (Trust me, after you've given up that option, and then come back to it, you'll really notice the difference.  Why Apple hasn't picked up on that yet, I'll never know...) There is also the option of downloading Skyfire, which works very well, sometimes faster than Opera.  Both platforms support Flash, and display the full-page layout, like you'd see on your PC.  Either way, pretty enjoyable experience there.-Text/Multimedia Messaging: Windows finally incorporated the threaded conversation for text messaging, much like the iPhone did, creating a more \"IM\" feel to conversations, and making it much easier to keep track of specific conversations.  It lags a bit, as mentioned prior, but a great improvement, without a doubt. It also does Multimedia messaging, and for that alone, in some ways, it is worth more than the iPhone, since Apple still refuses to include that basic function.-Camera/Video/Music: The camera is 3.2 MP, a very decent camera, especially considering the phone size.  It includes a flash, and can be adjusted for various speeds, colors, effects, etc.  There is also a video-camera, which records up to 30fps, though only 24fps, I believe, for the American version.  Why the difference, I couldn't say.  The music player is easy to access (it has it's own panel), and there is also a Sony FM radio included, which is a nice touch, and easy to use, though only with the headphones included, since they act as an antennae, apparently.  Still, very decent media package.-Construction: I have the silver finish, which is really just stunning.  It's very has a very durable, solid feel to it, though can be somewhat slippery, and feels very comfortable in the hand.  The size in my opinion is perfect, compact and sleek, and though this means smaller screen size and somewhat cramped keys, it's really my favorite aspect of the phone.  Has the old, comfortable handset feel of a Nokia candybar phone, actually. Sony really put a lot of thought and effort into it, and it shows.-Other features:  The 3.5mm headphone jack is WONDERFUL.  I had a Sony a few years back, and the one sticking point that kept me from using it as a full-time MP3 player was the fact that I was supposed to use Sony's headphones.  The fact that Sony has branched out, and incorporated the headphone jack, along with the capabilities for a Micro SD card slot (located on the side, when you remove the back cover), really shows that they're creating a platform which is more friendly to users who branch between companies. (Sony usually has their own M2 storage card, which is more pricey than the Micro SD.) Whether it lasts or not depends on their continued association with HTC, I suppose, who designed and helped create the physical phone. I suspect that if they next phone doesn't run Windows Mobile (which has been rumored), those features might disappear. Oh well.  The fact that they're included on the Xperia is really a very nice, convenient touch. The phone also connected with the network very easily, loaded all the information, and formatted the phone, without any heavy programming from me, which was awesome.Overall?  Fantastic phone, with very reliable software, convenient system, sleek and sturdy construction, speedy network connections (even overseas), and plenty of opportunities for personal tweaks and modifications, given the open platform from Windows.  I'd love to give it five stars, instead of the four, but the price was ridiculous, especially considering that it's really just another Windows Mobile smartphone, albeit better-looking and more personal than some others.  Still, it's without a doubt my favorite phone to date, when combining the ease of use and construction appeal.  Well worth buying, if you can burn the money.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fully-loaded, functional and sleek, yet over-hyped, and certainly over-priced", "unixReviewTime": 1228780800, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2008"}

{"reviewerID": "A1O22UA181NUXO", "asin": "B001HSMHGO", "reviewerName": "Peter Nguyen", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Here is a review of the Xperia X1. I have owned the X1, HTC Touch Pro2, HTC HD2, Nokia E90, Nokia E72, Nokia N95 and Apple iPhone. Other than the iPhone, I really hate this phone.1) Build Quality - the plastic on this phone peeled off everywhere! The finishing on this phone is very susceptible to friction. The plastic chrome will peel off. The paint on the metal battery cover will scratch or peel off. The internal housing will crack. It's like the device had an earthquake and cracked itself. I didn't even sit on the device or drop it on anything. There is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling. All of this happened within 6 months.The keyboard will also loose sensitivity. Over time, you will have to press on the keys harder and harder when you want to type something. The keyboard will only satisfy you for a year. And on top of that, the keyboard sucks. Don't even think about speed typing on this bad boy.2) Efficiency - the phone is very inefficient. The terrible feedback on the keyboard forces me to use the virtual keyboard on the phone. On top of that, the screen is so small that using the virtual keyboard is a nightmare. This prevents me from being efficient with contact management and note taking. In deterred me from actually using the calendar and responding to text messages and emails. Unlike on the E72, I was not motivated to be organized with the software.The phone is also very, very slow. Even with the latest firmware, it is very slow. This made me abhor using this phone for any reason. Don't even think about installing software that runs in the background, because it will eat your battery and retard your phone. The only way to make the device run at decent speeds is to minimize the software and the ROM.3) Battery - the battery life is terrible. It only lasts 12-15 hours on standby without 3G enabled.4) Camera -  the camera doesn't beat the N95, but it's alright. The camera software is sluggish and is very uncomfortable to use. The camera has bad auto focus and weak flash LED.5) Multimedia - the speakers on the phone is very weak so don't even bother watching movies or listening to music. Since this is a touch screen device, the screen isn't big enough for me to enjoy videos or web-browsing.The sluggishness of this device also applied to it's Wi-Fi. That's why I avoided web-browsing altogether. It was just plain terrible. In fact, I prefer the Nokia E90 or Nokia E72 for web-browsing (they are non touch screen phones).6) Phone - the call quality and loudness was at least better than my Nokia E72. However, the X1 speakerphone can't even compare to the E72 speakerphone. Please recall that phones usually have two separate speakers: the speakerphone/loudspeaker and the normal speaker. Well, the X1 has a very bad speakerphone/loudspeaker.8) Internet - the internet is slow, the screen is small, and the CPU needs an update. This should conclude everything.9) Price - at 800 U.S. dollars, it was an expensive piece of junk. But now that it is sold for 400 dollars brand new, it's a little more forgiving.10) Something to consider - regardless of all of the cons I have provided, I enjoyed using the phone because it was highly customizable. Unfortunately, it lacked everything I expected from what was advertised: an awesome keyboard, perfect build quality, fast processor. I tried to make the best of it by customizing it with software and 'tricks' and that alleviated some of the pain. Also, so many people complemented on the beauty of my X1.11) History on X1: When the X1 first came out, all of the reviewers gave the phone high marks for it's amazing build quality. Within a year, everyone noticed that its cosmetic and physical condition deteriorated greatly. The phone reviewers returned the X1 to the 'lenders' before they got the chance to witness the true nature of this phone.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "This phone was a nightmare!

When I buy something, I want it to look good, feel good, smell good and perform well. If a product has any small issue, it tends to get under my skin. I initially bought a Proporta case for my new iPhone, and while it looked pretty nice, it wasn't a snug fit, and it was smooth and shallow enough that the phone could easily slip from my grasp, and not have good shock protection. The sides buckled just enough to expose the silver casing at times, which drove me crazy.I almost didn't get the Otterbox because I thought it looked bulky and heavy, but the pictures don't do it justice. It is NICE. It's lightweight, fits snugly, and has plenty of shock protection. I like that it covers up most of the buttons that tend to get smeared when they are exposed. The front of the case is not flush with the screen, which protects it should the phone fall face down. The silicone is smooth and feels really good in the hand, and the nubbly surface and high corners make for a nice, secure grip when you're holding the phone. It's not gonna slip, and if it does, it's well-cushioned when it hits the ground.The hole in the back for the Apple logo bugged me a little, so I cut a small piece off the enclosed screen cover and placed it over the logo before putting on the case.

I went from a candybar 6230 to a flip N75 and then to this slider N85.I did a TON of research on which phone to get. I've read practically every N85 review available thru google and then some. 3G was a must along with a good camera.I looked at the N79, N78, N82, N95 and the N95 8GB.I ruled out the N79 and N82 because they didn't have 3G (I have at&t;).The N78 was good because it brings me back to the candybar style (I'm not sure about the durability of sliders) but the camera didn't have a cover and it was only 3.2MP. Plus, most reviews said the software was buggy and for practically the same price you can get this N85 and get more features. The clear button being on the bottom was a deal breaker, also.So I went to a Nokia store and was stunned by the N95 8GB screen. The thing just looked massive. I considered a regular black or red N95 but its screen was recessed and I didn't like that (hard to keep clean). And the thing just looked THICK. Plus, it didn't have a dual LED flash and no lens cover or FM transmitter.I narrowed it down to either the N95 8GB or this phone.I finally decided the OLED was better than LCD (for battery life and viewability). And the navigation key was larger and has the added bonus of having a navi wheel. The n85 also had a lens cover and dual LED. Plus Euro 3G compatibility on top of the US3G. Plus Symbian OS 3rd w/ feature pack 2.So I was sold and I've been trying to play with the phone the past week...Build Quality..Somebody said it was made in China so it must suck. Well, my N75 was made in Finland and that thing was horrible. It fell apart after a few months (hinge problem). So for this phone I read both ways.. some said it was solid, some said it was flimsy. I've held all phones in my hand and this one feels pretty solid. The slide doesn't wobble when opened or closed. The plastic does not feel cheap at all. It doesn't attract thumb prints or grease like the N75 did. Or maybe you can't see it as much since it's all black.MP3 player..It came per loaded with an 8GB card with some music and accompanying album art:Blind Sorrow - Pritchard, Banks, Coons, DilkBring the House Down - Ben WheelerHot Nights - Ian Clarke, Simon PainterLove Forever - Vanessa CondevSee Me Alive - The WinylsWaste - Robert J. Walsh, Rober GradWhenever You Say Love Me - Day ElevenWon't Let Go - NegativeYou Got the Message - Leigh GracieNavi wheel works great while browsing your songs (feels just like an ipod scroll:)Software..Everytime you get on a menu and you stop for a second.. you would have to tap the buttons twice. Once to wake it up then another to actually select it. Kinda annoying but I got used to it.Games Included w/ Free trial:Block Breaker - I've played it before and didn't like it. Deleted.Space Impact Kappa Base- kinda like Galaga shooter w/ excellent graphicsTetris - no change from a typical tetris gameSnakes Subsonic - horrible. Confusing and graphics suck.Asphalt 3 Street Rules - nice graphics but short run for trialFifa08 - once you picked a view (landscape or portrait) you can't change it. I picked landscape thinking it was the sideways option but it ended up being a portrait.. so i can't use the side buttons.World series of Poker - nice gameBrain Challenge - pick the answer by moving the selector up,dwn,lft, rightBounce - long install (5+mins) and long load times fire it up.Sims2 Pets -Creatures of the Deep -Midnight Pool -Reset GenerationI haven't played the last four games so I have no comment on those. The Ngage app is pretty useful for a few minutes or so to waste time but certainly not a psp or ds replacement. The side buttons are just too small. It will make your hand cramp.Now here's why i love this phone:Joikuspot Light -This app turns your 3G phone connection into a wifi hotspot. I use an ipod touch w/ version 2 software to connect to the internet. If I use the open option it keeps dropping the connection while you're on idle. The  WEP Shared did the same thing as well. The WEP Open works great and keeps the connection until you disconnect. The only limitation I found was that it didn't connect to any secured sites. IE the bank of america app on the ipod touch wouldn't connect. 3-4 hours of use with a fully charged battery.Internet radio -Inculdes FM radio broadcasts from your area. Some AM radio, too. Not as good as pandora (no album art or music background literature) but good enough. Plenty of ad free music and it can be broadcast thru your car radio with the FM transmitter! Full charge battery lasted about 3 hours with just using this app non-stop.Google Maps -I read somewhere that 3rd party apps couldn't access the GPS but that's not true. Google maps acquired your position within SECONDS. Or sometime a couple of minutes. It does drain the battery, though.Nokia Maps -Turn-by-turn voice navigation is free for three months. I tried it out and works fine. Had to restart that phone because it couldn't get a GPS signal for 30mins. There's no tone to let you know when to actually turn it just comes on and says.. 'NOW TURN RIGHT 200 YDS THEN LEFT IN 2.1 MILES' I think it's a great backup GPS but not a replacement. I say that because I can't keep it on the dash and I don't have car charger. It drained from a full charge to halfway within 45mins.Download!An app/link that shows you all the available software that can be downloaded over the phone. Most are free trials and most are useful. I have the Accuweather Bug (Forecaweather is nice but you have to pay for it!). Fring is an all in one IM (yahoo, gtalk, aim, etc) and it's free. It also lets you make VOIP calls thru wifi but I haven't tried it.Overall, the feature pack 2 is definitely an improvement over the N75. It's hard to explain but some little things that irked me about the N75 have been substantially fixed or changed this time around.The front panel green button (call) and red button (disconnect) are actually separate buttons which is good. I couldn't see that from the pictures.FM transmitter -I thought I could broadcast my phone call through the radio but that doesn't work. What works is having the Internet Radio/ Podcast/ MP3 player on + the AGPS voice guided Nokia maps. You have commercial free radio/Music that fades out when the voice nav comes on, and fades back in when it's done giving directions. Awesome.Battery Life -2.5hrs with Internet radio3.5hrs with just Joikuspot LightInternet on/off, light texting, a few calls - 6-8hrsOLED -Reminds of that time I took the cover off the 6230 and saw the LCD screen 'naked' and thought 'Wow, this is really clear.' Direct sunlight does make the screen unviewable. But indoors/ inside a car, it's an excellent screen.Keypad -Obviously smaller than the N75 but practically the same size as the 6230 so I have no complaints. It does get some getting used to txting/typing on a flat keypad but I got used to it after a couple of days.What I didn't like about the phone:-USB charging port ONLY. Although it did come w/ a USB wall charger, there will no more going to a friend's house and borrowing their Nokia charger.-Front keys are little hard to press. Compared to the N82 navigation button it's definitely more difficult to press. The N82 felt like butter this one not so much.-The naviwheel is not perfect. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.-FM transmitter was a little weak. Anything farther than an arms length and it fazed out.-Music store is not avail yet for the US.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nokia N85 RM-334 Software version 11.047", "unixReviewTime": 1233360000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2009"}

The sound quality on a good pair of headphones is top-notch as well. The call quality is pretty good, and reception is better than average. The FM transmitter works well only if the channel you're using has no signals near it in frequency, but when in my car i use the auxiliary input instead. Another welcome surprise was the internet radio quality, which lets me stream music mostly uninterrupted. INternet is speedy on 3G, but flies on a wi-fi network. Tethering is also possible with the right circumstances.With any new phone, there are bound to be bugs, but this phone has been out for over 6 months, and still has buggy software. The phone sometimes freezes during music playback, and unfreezes only when slid open or closed. The audio switches from headphone to speakerphone when you get a message, which can be quite annoying. The video recording sometimes freezes, a problem caused apparently by fragmentation on the microSD card. If you can put up with those issues, then this phone will work well for you.Some other notes. The slider has some give, and makes the phone feel a bit flimsy, but I have dropped it once with no repercussions. Purchase a good pair of headphones, and IMMEDIATELY apply an invisishield cover to protect from scratches, to which the N85 is quite prone.Also, do NOT install the Nokia software suite unless you have to, as it will run a process on your pc which will slow your pc way down.

{"reviewerID": "AU5V90NU1ON6O", "asin": "B001IBIM00", "reviewerName": "Tor Slettnes", "helpful": [79, 90], "reviewText": "This is an updated review; I originally wrote it before this phone was commercially available in the USA.  After having tried one out in a store in Singapore, I had decided to keep myN95 8GBand wait for theN97instead.  First, I was unimpressed with the keypad design, as the flat surface gives you very little guidance to help you hit the right keys.  Plus, both the N85 nor theN96are merely incremental upgrades, neither one offering the type of groundbreaking advances that the N95 did two years ago.Well, being a compulsive gadget geek, I succumbed in a weak moment.  As the price started dropping (and it has been dropping fast, and continues to do so!) I latched on.  The couple of factors that did it for me was the bright, crisp screen (and it is gorgeous!) and its smaller, more pocket-friendly size compared to the N95.  Also, I liked the new features that it offered: Tri-band UMTS (\"worldwide\" 3G), FM transmitter, a UI upgrade with \"transition effects\".I was soon taken in with the N85.  Not only does it have a much sleeker and modern-looking design than the N95 (especially the N95-3 now looks klunky by comparison), but there are dozens and dozens of little details that have been tweaked in the user interface, making for an overall more pleasant experience.One thing that came up for me, as apparently for many others, is the issue of build quality.  After having used the N85 for less than two weeks, a lot of dust had gathered underneath the display - it turns out it is not sealed properly onto the base.  I returned it to Amazon for a replacement - initially I actually ordered a N96 because of this issue.  It turns out that there were other problems with the N96 (particularly related to its slow performance and low available run-time memory), so I returned that too in favor of my second N85.  This time I was luckier, and I can now say that I have never been as happy with any other phone.My original review follows, including some reasons I had planned to forgo it; I have marked updates as appropriate.Both the N85 and N96 incorporate nearly every feature of the N95: GPS w/optional voice navigation, 5 MP camera with LED flash (though these newer models use two LEDs for brighter indoor pictures) and built-in geotagging, support for up to 32GB of SDHC removable memory (currently 16GB are largest available), standard 3.5mm headphone/headset connector which doubles as a TV-out port, comprehensive bluetooth suppport, and last but not least Symbian S60 (by far the most popular smartphone operating system in the world, far ahead of Windows Mobile, Blackberry OS, iPhone, etc - with a corresponding wealth of available applications).  See my review of the N95 8GB for some more details.  Also, both the N95, N85 and N96 are issued in a \"standard\" version for international markets, and a \"NAM\" version for enhanced support of North American 3G networks.The N85 and N96 differ from each other as follows:UPDATE: I have added the older N95 8GB into the mix for comparison's sake.* The N85 has a 2.6\" OLED screen, whereas the N95 8GB and N96 has a 2.8\" standard LCD screen.  OLED offers brigher colors, especially in sunlight, and lower power consumption (longer battery life).  That's because the pixels themselves illuminate, rather than relying on a backlight to do this.* Both the N85 and N96 are running S60 release 3 \"Feature Pack 2\", which means that they support \"transition effects\" for an overall smoother UI and interactive experience.  In particular, the N85 seems overall more \"modern\" than the older N95.  (ADDED 3/19/09)* In addition to quad-band GSM/2G (850/1900 MHz for North America, 900/1800 MHz for the world outside), the N85 also has a tri-band UMTS radio.  The North American version supports the 850/1900 MHz UMTS bands (for e.g. AT&T;), plus 2100 MHz for roaming internationally, while the N85 8GB NAM and N96 NAM only supports 850/1900 MHz.  (Conversely, the international versions of the N85 and N95/N96 support 900/1900/2100 MHz and simply 900/2100 MHz, respectively).  In short, it means that if you take your N85 with you abroad, you should still be able to get faster 3G coverage in most places where available, something which is not true for either the N95 or the N96.  (Plus, among the North American models, the N85 is the only one that also will work in Japan, since there is no 2G/GSM network available there, only 3G/UMTS over 2100 MHz).* The N85 has a built-in FM transmitter, for streaming voice calls and music e.g. to your car stereo.  This is particularly useful if your car is not equipped with bluetooth (incl. A2DP) technology.* The N96 has a built-in TV tuner, supporting DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds).  However this feature is not enabled in the North American version, because such broacasts are not available here.  AT&T;, like other North American carriers, have instead chosen to use MediaFLO for digital video broadcasts.* The N96 has 16GB of built-in mass storage, in addition to a SDHC slot.  Thus, in theory, it is able to store up to 48GB of data with the addition of a 32GB SDHC card.  The N95 8GB is limited to the same 8GB of memory for its lifetime, while the N85 has a SDHC slot (I currently use a 16GB card in it).* The N85's processor contains a 369 MHz ARM11 core, while the N96 has a dual 264 MHz ARM9.  It is difficult to say which one performs better, but both use Symbian S60 version 3 feature pack 2, which offers significant improvements in interactive feel over the N95 (which contained a 333 MHz ARM11 core).  That said, none of these have the graphics coprocessor that the N95 did, so applications (mainly games) that are optimized for this, will run much faster on the older N95.  The N95 also wins hands down in JBenchmark trials.UPDATE 3/18/09: Now having owned/tried all three, I can say that overall, the N85 is the snappiest one of the bunch.  The N96, in contrast, is quite underperforming; it even has problems streaming audio to my Pioneer car stereo over Bluetooth A2DP without hickups every 11-12 seconds.  As for interactive use, both the N85 and N96 feel a little bit quicker than the older N95.* Some people have complained about cheap, plasticky build quality on the N85 (see e.g. HowardForums); in particular, the keypad is seemingly somewhat flimsy and simply glued onto the phone.  People who have tried both generally seem to prefer the N96 on this account.UPDATE 2/8/09: With a few day's use of the N85 under my belt, I'd say it is no worse than the N95.  The keys are flat and with less tactile feedback, so it may be a little bit more difficult to text with one hand; however it's no worse than, say, the Motorola RAZR or some Samsung phones.UPDATE 2/19/09: As described above, mine had a problem with the display peeling off the base, and dust gathering underneth.UPDATE 3/19/09: My replacement N85 has been stellar.* The N85 is smaller (mainly due to the smaller screen) and will fit easier into your pocket.  UPDATE: Both the N85 and N96 are slimmer than the N95.* Both the N85 and N96 use the micro-USB standard (a slightly wider and flatter connector than mini-USB as seen on the N95) for data, and both can be charged through this port as well.  In addition, the N96 has a separate Nokia charging connector.  Now, here is the single reason I will not be replacing my N95 with a N85: This connector is at the top of the phone!  To me, this is stupid (and the only reason I subtracted a star from my rating), because it precludes the ability for third party manufacturers of docks and cradles to create one that you simply dock your N85 into for syncing/charging.  This is especially important in your car, if you plan on using the GPS navigation feature of this phone (keep in mind that when the GPS reciever is turned on, the batteries are drained pretty fast).  With my N95 8GB, i simply got aBrodit/ProClip device holder, along with a correspondingvehicle mount from PanaVise, and voila - I have a very nice little GPS device/music player/etc readily available; the N85 is definitely a bit more cumbersome in this regard.  UPDATE: Obviously I caved in and got the N85 anyway.  [...] now has a cradle for the N85 - but as I said, it does require that you manually plug the charging connector into the phone.* As always, beware of rather dismal repair/warranty service from Nokia USA (c/o PALCO).  You buy it, you own it.  You should be able to do most repairs yourself, though, with parts from e.g. cnn.cn - once available for this device.  UPDATE: Various customer accounts both here and on[..] indicate that PALCO have gotten significantly better lately.All this said, the bottom line is that there is simply no match for these phones when it comes to their sheer capabilities and the amount of features found on them.  Sure there are phones out there with more emphasis on ease of use and eye candy (e.g. iPhone), and sure there are ones with their own unique features/gimmicks (e.g. the Google Applications in the new T-Mobile G1) - but Nokia S60 smartphones are widely regarded as pure workhorses with the best overall feature sets.The N85 pushes the limits a little further, and is perhaps the phone with the most capabilities on the market today.  But if you are concerned about a solid build, you might want to consider the N95 8GB or N96 instead.  Or, wait for the newly announced N86 8MP, where apparently a lot more attention has been paid to build quality.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Gorgeous looks, unmatched features; check forums for user experiences", "unixReviewTime": 1228089600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2008"}

After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed, easily and permanently, with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data.  A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out.  But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office.  Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago.  It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming.  It also works world wide on WIFI for $5 a month.  Service is unlimited and has no contract.  An unlimited call and text plan is $10 a month, and unlimited cell, text and data is $25 a month.  You do have to use their phone (Moto X $299 or Moto G $149_ because they need Republic's proprietary software to work.  I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly. They give customers this link for $20 off when you join.  [...]", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "May not be needed", "unixReviewTime": 1403395200, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2014"}

There are three tough spots on my daily commute where my calls get consistently dropped, and I barely get any signal at my house. I was curious to find out if the Wilson MobilePro would be able to help. The short answer: it does the job, as long as you install it properly.The Wilson MobilePro is designed to improve coverage in your car or in your home (compatible with major carriers, but check compatibility before you purchase).The package contains everything you need to set it up at either location: a magnetic antenna for outside of your vehicle, a suction cup antenna mount for home use, an adhesive mount to attach the device inside your vehicle, a USB/mini USB cord, a cigarette lighter/USB power adapter (for in car use) and a 110/USB power adapter (for home use). It also comes with a convenient zippered pouch that holds all the items.Installing the device in the car is extremely easy, although you will need to plan ahead if you want to run the cables tidily. You probably want to purchase a multiple cigarette lighter adapter to avoid hogging up one of the few available connectors; I'm using amultiple USB power adapterinstead.You need to locate the box as close to your phone as possible (a foot or less works best) and the antenna as far away from the box as possible. If the separation between antenna and box is insufficient, the single light on the box glows orange instead of green. It reverts to green once the problem is corrected.The antenna attaches easily to the roof of your car with a strong magnet; you run the cable into the car and connect it to the box. The very simple instructions are easy to follow and most people should be able to install it in under 10 minutes.In the couple of weeks I've had to test the device I have noticed a marked improvement over the quality of calls and a dramatic reduction in dropped calls. Obviously, it can't create signal where there is none, but if there is the slightest signal you will be able to use it.There are very few areas where I think this product can be improved. One is the dual home/car use; although both uses are supported, the mounts and antennas are not designed to make switching an easy, daily task, but apparently to save the manufacturer a SKU. It would be nice if it shipped with two antennas, two power cords, and two docking stations, one for home and one for the car.Another limitation is the length of the cords supplied. Although they're sufficient for most sedans, owners of large vehicles may need to purchase a longer power cord -- or find an antenna with a longer cord.The Wilson MobilePro is a well designed, easy to install kit that works well. If you live in a weak signal area and get dropped calls often, it's well worth a try. It can also be quite useful to boost signal at a desk (but be aware that its range is extremely limited).Great product, highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for spotty coverage areas", "unixReviewTime": 1266451200, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2010"}

Wow was I pleasantly surprised!!  It was extremely easy and intuitive to install, took less than a minute, and within seconds, increased the reception of our Verizon Wireless phones, both of them.  Simply attach the suction cupped antenna holder to a window, snap the magnetic antenna onto the holder, attach the antenna to the amplifier, plug into your power source of choice, and you're ready to go if your phone is within a couple feet from the amplifier.  This is not a miracle worker, however, and the phone absolutely must be close to the amplifier or it does nothing other than look cute with the amplifier's little glowing green light.  Wearing my Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece (Cerise) gives me more mobility, so I can move a little farther from the cell phone to continue a conversation and enjoy the reception.In the car, this is an excellent enhancement!  I traveled through areas where calls usually are weakened and again I was amazed.  I seldom have lost calls to begin with, so this has not been an issue, thank you Verizon Wireless in my home area.  The magnetic antenna is secure and the cable is of a small gauge which makes for simplicity in slipping through the window, across the dash and into the amplifier.  I'm not thrilled about having to secure the amplifier holder to the car using the attached adhesive pad and have it rigged up to be used without securing the holder to the car permanently.  In the Wilson video, another holder is used which slips into the car air vent, but that was not included with this package.  What is included is a USB cable that attaches to your computer, an AC/DC adapter or cigarette lighter adapter, a little alcohol pad for using the adhesive backed holder for car installation, and a zippered canvas carrying case.

My town is hilly, has lots of tall buildings, and there are large numbers of wireless users. Consequently, cell signal coverage here is very spotty and can vary greatly within the space of just a few yards.What it can do:*Extend a cell signal from a relatively strong area to a weaker area. For example, if an exterior facing room has stable cell coverage, the Mobile Pro can be used to allow cell phone use in a nearby room with weak coverage.*Increase the likelihood of a stable cell signal while traveling in a vehicle. I did not test this use.What it can't do:*Create cell phone coverage where there is none.*Blanket a large area with a strong cell signal.Does it really work?*Yes, as long as one has realistic expectations. As long as users stay close to the amplifier (say, within 3 or 4 feet) and the antenna has access to a stable signal, the Mobile Pro performs well. On the other hand, the unit will not give a cell phone cordless phone functionality, with the ability to wander around an entire office or house, nor will it generate a \"5-bar\" quality signal from a weak source signal.Other observations:*The amplifier casing is made of brittle plastic. It probably won't survive a long drop onto a hard surface without cracking or chipping.*The accessories, especially the antenna and window bracket, are sturdy and well made.*Clearly written instructions and support contact info are included.Bottom line: I found the Mobile Pro to be useful for extending cell signals in a room with decent coverage in one area and unstable coverage in another area. Don't expect any miracles, though, like creating a robust signal in a dead zone or clearing out network congestion. I like the ability to run the amplifier from three different power sources: AC, USB, and vehicle cigarette lighter.

But given the mediocre AT&T; (yes, I'm an iPhone 3G user) reception in the heart of Silicon Valley I thought this device might help. A co-worker told me good things about the Wilson Electronics brand and this device is made and supported in the USA!First of all, I'm not a fan of using mobile phones in cars for the distraction reason -- and adding more lighter plugs and cords is a messy affair. So my goal of this review is to explain how the device works in my apartment sticking the antenna to the window. First of all, per the instructions, you do need to keep the actual device (which you'll keep near the phone) AT LEAST 8 feet/2.5 meters from the included antenna or there will be no effective coverage change (and the device will light yellow instead of green.) After doing that, I placed a couple of calls with my iPhone (and still had a dropped AT&T; call, though that probably isn't the direct fault of the device) and the 2 out of 5 signal strength bars didn't go up a bit. I wasn't looking for the device to improve 3G or EDGE coverage as I'm using WiFi at home for that anyway.As other reviewers have said, your phone needs to be within 6in to 12in (15cm to 30cm) from the device to amplify the signal. Yes, I tried that and no change. That's not real great for using a \"mobile\" phone if you truly need to be stationary. Then half the time when standing right next to it the light turns yellow which makes the device useless for boosting the signal. Maybe I'm better off using theWilson Electronics 801247 Desktop Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home or Office - For Multiple Usersfor that purpose, but as I haven't tried that, can't comment on whether it really helps or not.The device, however, is well built. All the necessary accessories are included, and, handily, the device is powered over the USB standard so you can use whatever existing cords and adapters you may already own. Perhaps in some conditions with other carriers, phones, or a different location you'll get better reception, and in that case, it might be worth the high asking price. I'll have to try it out the next time I visit family in rural Marin County (north of San Francisco) where cell phone signals are very sparse to begin with to see if this device improves extremely poor conditions.

MSakamoto \"boy clothes\"", "helpful": [83, 85], "reviewText": "SummaryThe MobilePro, like all cell phone \"signal boosters\" must be understood for what it is and isn't in order to keep expectations in line with reality. This is best accomplished by reading the instructions completely and also by reading this review as well as a post I made about a fixed point booster set up a few years ago (Wireless Extenders YX-500 PCS zBoost Cell Phone Signal Booster up to 2500 Square Feet of Coverage for Home or Office (1900 MHz Phones)). The title of that review was \"Good if you follow ALL directions (and mine as well)\". Taken within that context, the MobilePro does what it's supposed to do, which is help bring weak or locally blocked cell signals from a few feet away to your cell phone. Perhaps the proper name for a device like this is \"signal relay\" because that is what it really does. It \"relays\" cell phone radio signals back and forth around obstacles like the walls of home and the metal body of your car.Pros* It works - if you have three bars at the window of your car or office, but only two bars inside near your cell phone, you can use the MP to bring the stronger signal to your phone.* Compact - The whole unit packs nicely into a supplied case and has both wall and car power as well as all cables and the antenna.* Easy to set up - no menus or settings to deal with. No switches. Just plug it all in.* Clear use instructions* Well made and has good accessories for mounting the antenna on windows and magnetic metal. The booster unit itself can sit on your desk or be clipped to an A/C vent in your car.Cons* The advertising is a bit optimistic about the results. This does not create signal where there is none. As detailed in the referenced review, you are really transporting the best local signal to your phone from a few feet away. That is, if you have only one bar of signal in your area, even if you go outside and stand on a roof, you are NOT going to suddenly get a legitimate four bars using this device. Even if you hook it up and get more bars than the best local signal, it's not real because your cell phone meter will be influenced by the strength of the signal between the booster and the cell phone. I believe Wilson has designed the MP to minimize this effect, but it is still there. So, you're thinking you perhaps have three bars, when in fact you only have one \"real\" bar of reception.My ExperienceI used the MP in two environments. The first was in my home office. I was getting marginally acceptable reception while sitting at my desk and usually would stand near the window with my mobile (Blackberry Tour from Verizon) when an important call was in process. I then installed the MP on the inside of the window I used to stand by and then ran the long antenna cord down to my desk near my flat panel monitor. This distance is about six feet, which is in the range of the user manual recommendation. That is, the MP won't function correctly if you place the antenna too close to the MP electronics. This took all of sixty seconds or so. The MP electronics takes power from a mini-USB cord, so as long as you can supply full USB load from your PC, you can power the unit from either your PC or from the supplied AC source. After installation, including removing my phone from my nerdy belt holster and putting it right next to the MP, I was able to get the full signal available at the window on my handset all the time. Now, you might say, \"Hey, did you have to put your head down next to the phone on your desk?\" No, I have a bluetooth headset that I use with this setup so I don't have to move the phone. Since the range of the MP to your phone is rather limited (a couple feet), you really want to have a wireless headset since even a corded headset will be too restricting.The result was very good. I am very happy having this thing on my desk keeping my connection good at all times. On average, it successfully brings the window signal strength to the handset, which means a full three or four bars instead of one or two bars. Now, this isn't too absolute of a measurement since \"bars\" aren't really a unit of measure, but in practical terms it means my calls no longer break up at all, my BB downloads emails faster and all is well.The second use is in the car. I had a long \"work\" call that I knew I would have to carry out while traveling to a family event. Part of the route would take us through marginal signal areas on Route 152 East, which is also known as Pacheco Pass to you who are local to the SF Bay Area. I have driven this route many times, so I knew where I would normally lose a call. The antenna was attached to the right rear window of our '06 Prius while I clipped the module to the passenger front vent on the dashboard. I had someone else drive while I conversed from the passenger seat with my BT headset. Of course, this meant that I had to be careful of the antenna cord while entering or exiting the car since it was strung across the door. I think I could do better if I took some time with it, but the test was to just get it in there and get going, so there it lay. In any case, the MP once again made a marginal connection an OK connection. It turned unserviceable into serviceable. Those places where I would normally lose the signal ended up not being a problem. This is different than saying \"perfect\" as clarity was reduced for a little bit. However, it all worked all the way on an hour long call, so I would say \"success\" again. All that said, I don't know if it would usually be worth the trouble. i guess it depends on where you are going and how urgent it is for you to talk right that moment.In areas of good signal strength (e.g. consistent 3 bars or better) the MP doesn't really seem to make a difference, but then this is what I would have expected. I didn't have any sub-marginal areas of \"nearly zero\" bars to check out, so I can't comment. I don't think I will take the time to go find one and test it out, either.ConclusionIf you have the need to route cell phone signals around small local obstacles as described above, this is a great deal for you. Remember, it is NOT like bigger home boosters that make it possible for you to roam around your house with your phone. You have to leave the phone next to the MP and you have to have some signal available at the antenna location. It's not magic, but it is a good portable cell relay of sorts. Just make sure you have some signal to work with, and it will work for you, too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This works, but you must follow instructions", "unixReviewTime": 1266883200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2010"}

If the answer is \"yes\" then buy this and don't look back. If you don't care about those sorts of things, then there are probably easier-to-use units out there.This is my second Jawbone; I used the original Jawbone for just over a year when it broke (turns out the warranty is only a year long!). I was actually kind of glad to get a new one because I wanted to check out the Jawbone 2. Well, the Jawbone 2 is smaller and, I think, easier to fit. It also makes more intuitive noises--the tones make it much clearer if you're turning it on or off. But the Jawbone 1 had certain things going for it that I miss. Most importantly, I like using voice dialing. With the Jawbone 1, you could just press the primary button to access voice dialing. With this one, you have to press the Noise Assassin button, which I've given up on finding. Even if I could find it, you would have to hold it down for two seconds, which is a lot less convenient than a single push. As far as I can tell the only reason why this change was made was to allow one to turn off the flashing light display by pressing the primary button five times in succession--a much less functional use for that button. Maybe the Jawbone 3 will fix this someday.With each of my Jawbones, I left myself a voicemail while driving at freeway speed to gauge the quality of the noise reduction. The original Jawbone was good, but this one is better. At 80mph I was speaking in a normal tone and I even cranked the music so loud at one point that I couldn't hear myself talk. When I picked up the voicemail, I couldn't believe it--my voice was coming through perfectly understandably as if I was speaking in the quietest room of the house. The part with the music had only the very slightest bit of noise to it. In short, the noise reduction on this thing is incredible. I'm also pleased to report that the major annoyance with the original Jawbone has been fixed: you can actually turn up the volume loud enough to hear the person you're talking to! (The original jawbone is known for not putting out much volume.)I disagree with other reviewers that the primary button is too easy to press when adjusting this unit to your ear. I like its sensitivity, and it's very easy to get used to handling it by the edges to avoid this issue. Let's keep in mind that the primary purpose of this unit is to get good sound quality and you get used to little stuff like this.Please note that despite what one of the other reviewers said, this bulk package comes with everything it's supposed to, which is the unit itself, the charger, several ear pieces, and several ear loops.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The only game in town for talking at freeway speeds", "unixReviewTime": 1232323200, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2009"}

The only minor negative design-wise on this particular 3XL version is that the loops are a little too \"tall\".  That is, they can accommodate a very wide belt.  I noticed on a smaller version of this case for the iPhone 5 that the loops are proportionally shorter and thus the case fits more snugly to the belt and body.  On the 3XL, the case flops a little on a normal width belt.  Having said that, this 3XL leather case fits an iPhone 5 with case pretty well, and that's why I bought it.  The iPhone 5 version of the Hector case fits a naked iPhone 5 perfectly and is a much more compact case with the exact same design elements, materials, and construction.  A couple suggestions for Krusell:  Re-locate the zip tie connectors to the back of the display card, not on the front between the case and the card where the connectors can scratch and dent the leather.  All the Hector cases I've bought have had scratches parallel to the belt loops due to the inevitable jostling during handling and shipping.  It's not a huge negative because the scratches are on the back of the case and not visible.

WAY too small, no stretching them....  Gave one to someone at work, wife with her HTC Aria has the other one.Finally someone pointed this one out to me, I ordered it immediately.  I love it, although I'm still working the case out a bit wider..  The length of the phone (and slim case) push out a tad on the case, making it narrow to fit the phone, but I've been putting an older phone about the right size (reasonably larger) in the case at night and it's slowly stretching.  I've thought about soaking it and then stretching it but so far haven't done this.But the case as-is is really nice.  The belt loops are solid and a in a good place, the Krussel clip system works good, I replaced the stock spring clip with the simple small clip which is all I need to keep it in place on my belt.  The clip is very thin, doesn't poke me etc..  The magnet is strong, never had it open on its own.  The case closes and opens a bit stiff, but given it's leather I think it'll soften up over time.  The inside of the case is soft and plush.The only dings I can give it are that it had a QA sticker on the INSIDE of the case, leaving a small sticky spot inside that I had to clean with alcohol, and that the threads binding the case are bright white, emphasizing the stitching.  While some people might like that, I personally would prefer they be black or more subdued.  The stitching itself is very well done, so no real complaint, just would prefer they're not so visible.

The pictures are nice and clear.  Low light was a little grainy, but still good with the flash.  Not a complete camera replacement for me, but perfect for getting those split second shots that you always wish you had a camera handy for.... and now I do!  Surfing the web with T-zones was also much zippier than my RIZR.  That was unexpected, but very noticable.  I have finally been able to get Opera mini to work.  Go to [...] to see how to hack the phone and update the firmware.  Magx Reloaded is a very nice firmware.I was a little suprised at the size being almost the same dimensions as my iPod touch, but about 1/2\" narrower.  Its about the same height and thickness.  Its not too big at all though and the phone feels nice and solid like my ipod.  Another physical feature that is obvious is that its a bar style phone (I usually stick with flip) and the screen can be subject to scratching.  I will certainly be getting screen protectors for this phone.  I have also dialed someone from mistake in my pocket due to hitting buttons.  There is a manual lock on the side, but I wish there was an option for an automatic lock like my RIZR.Something to note is I bought this off ebay with the seller claiming it was about two months old.  The \"messages\" button would audibly click but it would not pull up the messaging menu (probably why she was dumping the phone).  Before returning it, I did a reset with code 000000 and then the messaging worked fine.  Hopefully just a glitch that is fixed now.  Overall, I'm very pleased with all the features this phone offers and feel its a keeper!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Love it, love it!

I love this phone! My true rating is a 4.75 score but went ahead and gave it 5 stars for these reasons:PROS:1) Wi-Fi - The wifi works great on my home wifi and when I go to wifi hot spots. If I am within 250 feet of the wireless, no problem at all connecting.2) 3.5\" jack, I can connect this phone to stereo speakers or any headset that I want to for great stereo sound.3) FM Radio (must use headset). I have been able to get many stations clearly! (Better than on my desk set radio).4) Email setup - I was able to get on Gmail and Yahoo wonderfully with the built in email on the phone.5) The calendar/organizer - This is my FAVORITE feature of this phone because I can set alarms to go off during the day with the calendar and use my own voice memos to tell me what the appointment is for! This keeps me so organized!6) Notes and task list-This also keeps me organized with things that I need to do and notes as well.love all of the features and find it is fast and easy to use. Mine is not unlocked as I use TMobile. The WiFi is my favorite feature. The main reason that I bought this phone is because of the 3.5\" headphone jack and the FM radio and of course the Kodak camera. The FM radio picks up stations so clearly. Also, this phone has a wonderful calendar/appointment feature that you can insert an MP3 file, video or any voice note as your reminder on each calendar reminder. This phone is like having a secretary working for you. I also have a HTC Touch2 phone that is a touch phone and love it, but my Moto Zine is still my favorite as I give it 5 stars! (This superb smart phone does not deserve the bad rating from other people).7) The call quality is superb, when I call someone, I can hear them just like on a landline phone! And they tell me that I do not sound like I am on a cellphone, they hear me loud and clear!8) The messaging is great, you can send text, pictures, videos or audio messages.9) Great MP3 player, easy to set up play lists and the sound is superb!10) Camera takes great pictures, great to use when I forget to bring my regular camera!11) File Manager - You can find files, rename files, delete files from your SD card on this phone. And it holds a micro SD card up to 4 gigs, although I placed a 8 gig in it and it worked.12) Battery life - can go 2 days using Wifi, camera, phone etc on a charge. And on standby several days! (This phone has the longest battery life on any that I have used thus far).13) I use this phone as: 1) Phone 2) MP3 player 3) Radio 4) Appointment secretary 5) WiFiInternet use. It is like having a net book, phone, MP3 Player, radio, and secretary all in one.CONS:The only con that I have regarding this phone is that is does not read or write Word or Excel documents and I could not find any apps for this at this time. This is why my true score of this phone is a 4.75. However, because of all of the great things that this phone does for me, I give it this high scores as it is truly a great phone for me!

You know how a PDA is a cell phone with a built in computer?The Zine is a 5mp digital camera with video, auto focus and flash, with a built in cellular phone, FM radio that works great(!), address book, calculator, calendar, speaker-phone, music player, comes with online contacts storage, email (I have stored all my yahoo and gmail addresses easily and although it is not as complex as my computer- they work without a hitch) and text messenger, decent talk/standby time, caller tunes available and International calling capabilities. It even has a 'TALK' feature and read texts, numbers, contacts list-OUTLOUD, at your discretion. All available and usable WITHOUT an expensive data plan.It has great memory capability in the memory card and adequate in the phone. It comes with an adapter for the memory card to fit right into your computer directly, video/audio cables to hook to the TV, a USB cord, a decent headset and a Motorola phone tools CD, which doesn't come cheap.The only couple drawbacks is it has a weak keyboard (I have worn mine out too quickly) and it does not have the capability to 'cut and paste' text. The battery choice could have used some tweaking as well. It wears out easily, starts getting warm at times and drains quickly. I carry a vehicle charger. I am in the market for a better battery replacement, currently.The only other problem is no one carries Zine so it's hard to find and has fallen to the way-side in lieu of the PDA/BB/Touch-Screen fads.The cell companies can charge more for phones that REQUIRE a more expensive data plan to even be able to make a local phone call so they sinply don't want to carry a customer friendly phone, like the MOTOZINE 5.

Texting and SMS is fast and easy with T9. The internet(WAP), organizer, alarms, calendar, voice memos, and to-do list, are all easy to use and convenient. I have LOVED the MP3 player. The MP3 player sounds really good. It holds so many albums and the sound is fabulous. I use the OEM stereo ear buds that came with the phone and enjoy every minute of every song. I have an 8GB micro SD card in mine and it works perfectly.I have not had any of the problems some of the other users have experienced, except for a loose battery. So I folded a little paper and placed it on top of the battery, replaced the cover and solved that problem. I've dropped it many times and the only thing I've had to do is to make sure the battery was still making a good contact.It gets sluggish/weird if the memory is full of texts, music, or pictures or if the call logs are really long. All I've done is to very easily delete multiple texts, call logs and move my photos to the computer. EASY!I feel bad for the others who haven't had as good an experience as I have.

The construction is also first-rate.While I was pleased with the first model I ordered, I was curious about whether I would be happier with this flip open model. The truth is I prefer the other one, but people are different and it comes down to personal preference.What I love about this (and the other one from the same company), aside from the design and construction, is the fact that you do not replace the back cover of your phone with a part of a case like with other Galaxy Note 2 cases on the market. Another factor is value, which to me is what you get for the price. With this case or its sibling you get something to protect your expensive Note 2 at a very low price. And when you add in the attention paid to design and construction then the value becomes significant.Check out both models to find the case style that suits you.

I opted for the 9100 because of the shape of the display, allowing a better integration and because of the sleek design.In early '09 I had to fight with less performant firmware, but current versions are absolutely flawless and a lot better than most integrated systems I found on well established European brands.Basically this system has it all: Phone over car stereo, blue tooth playback of audio files from any blue tooth enabled device, USB (used for upgrading firmware, but also for charging devices), obsolete (old) Apple connector (can be upgraded to lightning with an adapter).A scenario I totally love is listening to music from my well located Note 3 phone, streamed from &#34;Spotify&#34;, having the navigation screen and if directions are spoken the music is muted and on top of that when a call comes in, that one will have priority over nav and music. As soon as you hang up, the nav/music scenario goes on...Only 4 out of five stars because the display could use a brighter setting besides the &#34;daytime&#34; one. In my convertible roadster I had to move the display to various spots in order to be able to read at open top and direct sunlight.The installation should not take more than one hour if the supplied harness fits your car stereo and about 2 1/2 hours if you need to cut into the car wires. Adapter harnesses for specific car makes are also available, but those will do the same thing as a skilled owner would do by cutting into the car wires.I have not yet seen a factory integrated system which will allow you (as the Parrot does) to listen to music while the navigation is on and on top of that allowing phone calls, but I will agree I haven't seen them all :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Probably the best after market solution for non-blue tooth fitted vehicles", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2014"}

The quality was just ok and it needed to be recharged about once a week which quickly became a pain to the point of it collecting dust.  Well, after local law enforcement \"reminded\" us about cell phone use, it was time to find another solution.This thing is great!  It's hard wired to the car and works very well.  Audio comes out of your car's speakers and the system automatically mutes music during an incoming call.  The mic also picks up very well, including passengers in the back seat.I was surprised at the iPod sound quality.  It sounded better than the aux input on our factory radio.  This is due to the unit having it's own amp which bypasses your radio's amp.  In the case of stock, it's better.  However if you have an aftermarket system, it may sound worse.Pros:1) Mic quality2) Sound quality3) Automatically mutes music4) iPod music sounds even better over a stock system.5) Steering remote works very well.6) Easier installation when using a car specific wiring harness (all plug n play).  In the case of our 2008 Honda Civic we needed a BT-1722-A adapter.  Amazon's recommendation was for the BT-1721-A adapter which is incorrectCons:1) Install may be difficult for some.  If you ever replaced a car radio, this'll be easy, especially with the harness.2) Screen could be brighter in direct sunlight.Note:- Unit came with software version 1.91 as indicated in the advanced settings menu and the white sticker on the blue brainbox.  You can download the latest software to a USB drive from Parrot's website.  Version 1.91 didn't seem to work with an iPad 2 as a music player.  Version 2.02 was available for download which corrected this problem.- For about the same price, you could purchase a new car stereo with built in iPod and BT, Pandora support and a better integrated amplifier than your stock radio.

I've seen those cheap signal boosters you put into your phone on ebay, and they just don't work. So needless to say, I was skeptical that a product like a the Wilson signal booster could really work for me. And I was wrong - mostly.If used properly, this signal booster should significantly decrease all frustration you once had with dropped calls and low signal problems. Since installing this in my car, I have dropped roughly 90% fewer calls. My bars went from 1 to 4 instantly as it was plugged in. My call quality improved dramatically too - once where there was static is now a clear conversation.The antenna itself is a little unsightly, especially when used in a car.  You need to put the antenna on your roof, and have the cable running through an open window.  I was able to shut my window just about all the way with it, so it shouldn't be much of a problem in winter. Unsightly - yes. Does it work - YES.*edit*I used it this winter, and though my car never got really cold inside, there was a constant whistling from the window being cracked open that drove me crazy.  So keep that in mind.I've also tried this antenna in various hotels that did not offer wifi. I have a Verizon card I plug in to my laptop to get 3g, but in some areas I travel, I was lucky to get 1X speeds. I just hooked up the signal booster and put the receiver within a couple of feet of my laptop, and wham - instant 3g coverage with pretty consistent coverage And the nice this is that it amplifies every signal within 2 feet. So if I'm using it for my laptop and also need to take a call, I get great reception on my phone as well. But that 2 feet is pretty specific - if you go outside of that range, it definitely drops off significantly. And it's not always consistent within 2 feet - sometimes you have to play around to find the right location.All in all, this is the best solution I've come across yet for low signal issues. It's not perfect, but it's far better than the other alternatives I've tried thus far. Keeping in mind its limitations (proximity to unit, inconsistent with signal, need to crack open window to use it in the car), it may be worth it for some people.

And if you're reading this, you're probably wondering the same thing, so lets get right to it:Does it actually work?YES!  My Sprint cell phone gets decent signal at home without this booster -- usually between 2 - 5 bars out of a possible 6.  But with this booster, I'm rock-solid at 5 - 6 bars at home.  At work, my cell phone reception is pretty dismal -- fluctuating from 0 - 3 bars at best -- so I was eager to see if this booster would improve that.  And guess what -- it did!  With this booster, I'm now at a consistent 2 - 4 bars while at work, so that's a pretty good improvement.No brainer setupI think the strongest selling point of this cell phone signal booster is the easy setup -- just plug it into a USB port, cigarette lighter or electrical outlet, then attach the antenna and place it in a window -- done!The only part that might cause a hiccup is making sure the antenna is far enough away from the base -- if they're too close, it creates a feedback loop and the booster won't work properly.  There's an LED on the unit that illuminates either amber or green -- amber means you need to reposition the antenna farther away from the base unit and green means the unit is operating properly.  But this minor setup requirement really shouldn't pose much of an issue.  I've had the antenna and booster as close as 5' from each other and it still lit green and functioned properly.RangeThe manufacturer says this booster was intended to be used no more than 2 feet away from your cell phone, and I'd say that's pretty accurate.  I don't need to move my phone very far before it loses connection with the booster and it has no effect whatsoever.  A slightly longer range might have been nice, but I guess I can just leave my phone next to the booster and use a bluetooth headset if I want to move around.At this point, I'm planning on using this with my laptop on the go, so I don't think the 2' limit will be an issue for me.  But I'm also considering using this in my car -- velcroing it to my dash and then velcroing my phone cradle on top of the booster, making the 2' range a non issue in that configuration.  But I have to decide where I need it most though, since I don't want to keep setting it up in the car only to remove it again for use with my laptop.Carrying CaseThis Wilson booster comes with a carrying case to make transport easy.  There's really not a whole lot to carry but it's still a nice touch.  Having said that, I'd rather have had a shorter case; as it is, it's needlessly long.  I assume it's meant to be a one size fits all solution for an array of Wilson products, perhaps accommodating kits with longer antennas.  But for this setup, the long case is a bit awkward considering this product is meant to be portable.  A minor quibble, but I think others would agree once they have it in hand.Form FactorNot a very attractive product really.  Just a battleship gray rectangular box and a stubby antenna.  Maybe something more appealing to look at would be a cool touch.  Docked a star for the uninspired design.  As it is, the design makes it obvious this costs nothing to produce which makes me question the hefty price tag.Things that make you go hmmmmmm....If cell phone radiation is a health risk, are booster antennas also a cause for concern??  Who knows; but it makes me wonder.  Maybe the 2' range is a good thing after all.Bottom LineIf you need a signal boost for your cell phone then this Wilson should do the trick.  Just be sure you don't need to wander more than 2 feet away from the booster; that, or be prepared to use it in conjunction with a bluetooth headset.  My Sprint phone got a stable boost of around 2 bars and the signal doesn't fluctuate as much in problem areas.  Thumbs up!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Yea or Nay?

Opening the installation guide, I attempted to quickly connect the signal booster in an attempt to test its capabilities.  Unfortunately the installation guide doesn't provide organized instructions for a quick install.  Installing isn't difficult, besides needing to know the antennae must be connected prior to the power, the rest is simple and intuitive.  I'm baffled as to why the install instructions are so kludgy and doesn't reflect this.Once I reviewed the install guide and took note of the warnings, I set up the signal for use indoors.  I set up the antennae first, stretched the cord a little over 8 foot away (recommended for indoor use), and placed the booster next to my wirelessly connected laptop.  There was a slight delay, but the signal gauge improved and decreased with each plug in and disconnect respectively.The Wilson Electronics 801242 MobilePro cell phone signal booster has a steep price, limiting those who would be willing to purchase this solution.  For me, it's a matter of productivity; I could easily justify the expense.  If you can justify the expense, and the install configuration isn't a problem for you, this signal booster is worthy of your consideration.PROS:Provides improved 800/1900 MHz cell signalSupports multiple 3G device simultaneouslyDerives power from outlet, USB connection, or lighter socketSimple to install and use1 year warranty with 30 day money back guarantyCONS:Kludgy install guideDoesn't work with iDEN/Nextel cell phones or cellular-based data cardsApproved use limited to the USA and Canada", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Amped: A Wilson Electronics 801242 MobilePro Cell Phone Signal Booster Review", "unixReviewTime": 1269734400, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2010"}

There is probably something more technical than wind direction involved in the service drops, but I'm not positive there is.I hoped that this gadget would set the service straight and steady. But did the Wilson boost the signal or were we just having a good day? Hard to say. While it was engaged, we never lost signal, but I can't say that the signal was improved, either. Maybe the bars on my phone lifted by one just because, or maybe they lifted because I pulled the phone away from my head to look and happened to angle the phone just right, thereby grabbing a better signal. From the Wilson? Could be.This was tough to review because it's hard to say if anything useful was happening.

I've used this with a Pantech UM175 modem and the Novatel U760 modem now, both on a cradlepoint router and it has worked very well. The Pantech had a weaker radio than the Novatel but became usable with this Wilson booster. The Novatel U760 is consistently faster now than before without the booster. I have tried a competitors booster ($$$) previously and did not have as good of results despite going to great pains to run coax cable through my house outside and this compact, easy to setup unit blows it's doors off. Not only is it better it is more flexible. The booster receives power from an ac adapter for household usage, a car adapter for long term on the road usage and can also go straight USB form a pc. It came with all of the necessary cables for the booster power and antenna. It boosts signal wirelessly so there is no cable to connect to an aircard. I have had my best boost come from being less than 2' away from it which is perfect for my application. This booster does not broadcast over a large area nor is it advertised to. It is more of a \"personal space\" application if you will. My aircard is in a router that covers my residence and my RV when traveling so as long as it gets a boosted signal everybody gets to enjoy it.Living in a rural area I will be sure to recommend this to my neighbors as it is a real difference maker.

I was a bit surprised when the package showed up and it was a lot bigger than I originally envisioned.There are a few parts to this device. The basic package includes the wireless Mobile Pro amplifier, the USB power cable and the cigarette lighter power supply with USB connection and is really only intended for use in a car.The amplifier itself is a little box roughly the size of an average mobile phone. By its name you can see that it's used to amplify the signal. It's recommended that you mount this rather large device on your dashboard, but the instructions do give you the option of attaching it to the back of your headrest if you need to boost your signal even more. Anything that's labeled a cell phone booster that is designed to sit directly behind my head... I'm leery of. Also, I found it amusing that this was a wireless amplifier, yet it came with a wire to run from the \"wireless amplifier\" to the cigarette lighter plug. I guess they had to power it someway, but the term wireless is a bit misleading.In addition to the basic package I also got the in-home accessory kit with AC power supply and window bracket, along with a mini magnet mount antenna. It's unclear if they sell this all together or not, but the instructions clearly indicate that these are a separate purchase item.The first thing I did was take this all apart and use it in the living room. I was a little surprised when I was setting this up to read that the antenna and the amplifier had to be at least 8 feet away from each other to prevent oscillation (whatever that means). Luckily the antenna came with an 8 foot cable to connect to the wireless amplifier. So I have the antenna on the window and 8 feet away I have the power amplifier on a table, and a few feet further I have the thing plugged into the wall. My wife takes one look and says simply \"no\", so I know this can't stay mounted like it is.But did it work? Yes - I was getting five bars across the phone on two different cellular networks. I considered this a complete success and made a few test calls. to make sure it worked. The only disappointing part came when I finally took down the system and realized that I was pretty much getting five bars of signal without the antenna. To be fair - I did get the signal coming and going without the antenna, so I would definitely say that this was an improvement.Taking this in the car was a similar story.I went on a trip and took this with me. Mine came with a portable bag that I could put all the pieces in and carry with me. It was actually rather large in my suitcase, so I wasn't impressed with its portability. When I did get to my destination, my brother picked me up in his hard top convertible. Since he had the top down, I began to see that this wasn't going to work. Eventually I got a rental SUV so I had another chance to test it out. Again, the antenna has to be 8 feet away from the amplifier, so the SUV had plenty of room for me to run wires to the back of the car and then out the window up to the roof. I even placed it on the center of the roof as the instructions suggest - although the cord hanging off looked silly and was clearly a temporary solution. Since it was a rental I didn't want to permanently affix the amplifier so I sat it upright on the seat next to me. To be fair here, they do have other optional mount-solutions available where you can take it on the road more easily.Did it work in the car? Again, I got five bars (only testing one network this time though). It was fairly consistent and overall I was happy with the function, if not the form. Would I have gotten 5 bars anyway? I'm not sure, but I never dropped a call when I was out of the car... So I'm not sure how much this was the amplifier working, or me really wanting the amplifier to work.So - final result? It seemed to do just what it was advertised to do. Did I get the occasional hesitation when talking? Maybe once or twice, but overall I thought I could hear pretty clearly, and I always had a strong signal strength. I could give it five stars on the functional part alone.But the form factor killed me. Long wires, multiple pieces, suction cups.. It was a bit bummed that I had to set up my own base station antenna to get it functional. In the SUV it was fine, but the convertible was a non-starter. Smaller cars I also imagine that you'd have trouble getting the 8 feet or separation.The instructions were clear enough, and mine came with a little video clip to show me how to hook it up, so I wouldn't say it was hard, but it was just time consuming. I'd give it three stars for design (and I think I'm being generous. I would have definitely kicked it up a star or even two if there was an option to slap a battery in it and just use the amplifier piece by itself, but the competition for my cigarette lighter plug outlet is too great.Other parting shots:-Okay, I guess the bag to carry it wasn't that big, but it was too big to fit in my carryon backpack, so it has to go in the suitcase.-I ended up putting it back in the house behind the curtain to hide it - so far the wife hasn't thrown it out the window.-The AC adapter is 110-220 so it works overseas. that is assuming that where you're going is one of the only two bands that the device supports.-Two weeks after I got it - I still hate the design.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Function over form.

I decided to watch installation on a video on the OtterBox site.One of the main issues with this holder that has nagged many a user is the oily bubbles (for lack of a better word) that appear on the screen between the case and the iPhone.  There is a solution to this which I used right out of the package - use a quick puff of baby powder on the screen.  Not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff.  There are instructions on YouTube which I followed and which work just great.Love the case.

I use the Fuze and my wife uses the iPhone.  Both have allot of terrific features and work very well, but they each have their niche of optimal user.  It is very much like comparing a Mac to a PC.  Whereas the iPhone is a relatively seamless package that just works, the Fuze provides customization options and access to countless outside applications that can keep one tinkering endlessly.  Sure, you could just stick to the AT&T; provided interface and applications and get a very decently working smartphone, but that's like asking Michael Phelps to break world records while wearing a business suit.I'm not going to go down the list of pros and cons outside of that because there are plenty of other reviews here and elsewhere to do that for you, but to sum it up:  If you just want something that works well and never want to tinker with how it works, there are better options, like the iPhone.  But if you want something that can do virtually everything the iPhone can do (the most noteable exception being no multi-touch on the Fuze) with the option to expand and modify it, the Fuze is a great platform to do that.Other points worth noting if you are the type to keep your mobile devices for several years are that you can simply replace a dying battery yourself with the Fuze, vs. sending the iPhone back to Apple, and the microSD card slot allows slick and easy memory swaps and upgrades.  Plus you are not tied to using iTunes to manage your applications and data when connected to a computer, with the option to use Microsoft ActiveSync or simple drag and drop style file transfer.  But don't expect it to be as easy either.  ;)The bottom line is that while my wife loves her iPhone and would never think to edit a registry setting, I love the versatility to tinker with the Fuze in ways that you simply cannot with the iPhone.  Similarly, I would never give my non-tech savvy mother a Fuze, whereas the iPhone would keep the \"Can you fix my computer?\" type of calls to a minimum.I only took away one star for two reasons.  The first of which was all of the useless demos and applicatons cluttering up the menus that AT&T; has included to sell you more stuff, and for the bulkiness of the package.

Lee", "helpful": [24, 34], "reviewText": "I own this and a Tilt, and I provide Windows Mobile applications and video drivers in my spare time.Easy to Google for benchmarks and details, as with the Tilt, this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented, inferior (4 TIMES slower) multimedia capabilities compared to other (Samsung, LG, Toshiba, Apple, Nokia) devices.  The FUZE actually benchmarks slightly slower than circa 2002-2003 200MHz PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia. It's unfortunate the htc class-action law suite hasn't panned out.This does have a superior keyboard compared to the Xperia X1, but the GREASY, finger-print attracting thin casing makes the phone feel like a toy.  The \"Diamond\" points in the back of the case also will wear in less than a week due to the poor plastic quality.VGA is amazing on this device albeit wasted on less than 2.8\" size instead of a more useful and eye-forgiving 3\".  You can actually also take photos with this versus the blurring/stuttering Tilt camera, and the pictures look spectacular.  Accelerometer-enabled album viewing takes much of the pain out of portrait vs landscape.  Too bad the album still isn't syncable with Picasa or such for easy off-loading.However, the new USB drive mode (directly accesses the microSD/HC and locks off access Windows Mobile), makes it easy to transfer files, or use a directory-based album browser for the photos.The auto-backlight tends to be too bright and doesn't get dark enough in dark settings.  Luckily there's apps such as LevelSight that can deal with this.HSDPA is locked off until you work around AT&T;'s registry locks so 3G speeds will be quite slow.  This is either because the towers are overloaded by iPhones, or the back haul off the towers are only 1Mbps max.The Push-To-Talk is useless and there isn't an obvious way to reassign the button for some other use.  Luckily, there's some hacks you can Google for to reassign it to do two different things such as bring up the Comm Manager, and the Camera app.Another major issue is the GPS is really slow for the initial lock.  It can take up to TWO minutes before it locks compared to a Tilt.  Turning on A-GPS (without signing onto AT&T; Navigator) doesn't improve the speed and will actually cause all 3rd party GPSs to loose their GPS lock repeatedly (in a 1 minute time span and beyond) including Garmin Mobile XT and iGo8 after finally getting that GPS lock.  Luckily again, there's an app called FusionGPSFix that attempts to deal with this.It's too bad this is a One and Company Design because the design is mostly about show and not reliable usability.For instance they destroyed the d-pad.  It's almost impossible to hit left or right on the 4-way direction pad because there is no pad, and the control surface is shared with 4 other buttons.  You're more likely to hit Dial or Home with a sloppy press for left.  You're more likely to hit Back or Hangup with a sloppy press for right.  These limitations hit especially hard if you want to just navigate in the Calendar program or play a game.Combined with the bad d-pad design is sharing the same surface with an iPod capacitive scroll capability.  Superficially, it would be nice for one thumb to be able to scroll iPod-like through lists and then hit the center button to select.  Reality is the drawing a circle around the center button results in not very responsive behavior, and moving the thumb to the center for selection can cause accidentally more scrolling.It's also inane to put the Volume and PTT button on the side of the slider face that makes it slide!  If you push any of these buttons, the whole face will twist and wiggle.  This really shows the keyboard-slide was a sloppy add-on to the original Diamond design.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "another inferior HTC/Qualcomm product", "unixReviewTime": 1228694400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2008"}

The CoverFlo might be appealing to some users, but turning it off was actually one of the first things I did upon purchasing the product.  For better or for worse, I'm used to Windows 6.x and I had no ambition to learn a new system.  Additionally, the CoverFlo would automatically hide some of the must-have Today Screen plug-ins I've become dependant on in the last year.The slide-out QWERTY responds well, but I'm dismayed at the lack of dedicated number keys.  I don't understand the logic of having a dedicated ( ) / or : keys...but not numbers.  It seems to me that people use the number \"1\" more often than the \";\" in text messages and emails.  The touch screen keyboard is big enough so that finger typing is quite possible with just a little practice, should you not want to pull out the stylus.  I am disappointed with the lack of buttons on the phone's front and the d-pad is one of the worst I've dealt with.The screen is amazingly crisp and bright.  It automatically adjusts to your lighting situation and does a respectable job even in sunlight.  This is a significant improvement over the previous two WM phones I've owned.  The screen definitely makes your overall experience more enjoyable.The biggest plus is the camera.  At 3.1MP with autofocus, I would say this might nearly pass as a digital camera replacement.  Every picture I've taken looks very sharp and is vastly superior to most phones out there.  It even records video in the MP4 format.  The clarity is decent and the frame rates are okay for a camera phone.  However, I'd still hang on to that digital camcorder for special events.  The Fuze's video is not as crisp as its still photos.I'm not overly impressed with the integrated GPS.  Yes, it does work with free programs like Google Maps...however, it spends a little too much time looking for satellites.  During a couple instances, I could not get it to find me at all while in the car.  If you're going to rely heavily on the HTC for GPS navigation, prepare yourself for a little frustration.One of the Fuze's best features is hidden in the Windows system folder.  There is a YouTube application that runs very well on AT&T;'s 3G network.  I would even dare to say the quality of YouTube is better on the Fuze than the iPhone itself.  My significant other has the iPhone 3G and in our side-by-side comparison, we both agreed the HTC prevails.Oh yeah, the Fuze makes calls, too.  I almost forgot that part!  There is nothing remarkable (or disappointing) about the call quality.  Personally, I think the volume is a little low even when cranked to the max.  You may have a different experience.  The onboard speaker is not tremendous either, so you'll want a headset if you plan on listening to music.In summation: Great screen, excellent camera, decent overall functionality, but the GPS and conspicuous absence of some keys might be frustrating at times.  I definitely like the phone and feel most WM6 users will as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Half Windows Mobile...Half iPhone", "unixReviewTime": 1232841600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2009"}

TouchFlo 3D is a great addition to this phone and makes is very easy to access the features you want to get to quickly. The keyboard is the best I have ever used and is far superior to software (on-screen) keyboards found on other devices. Media features are excellent. Great music and video playbackand the devices supports stereo bluetooth. the camera is great for a camera phone and takes great pictures in daylight, and even does ok in low light. The MP4 video recording is also of decent quality. The screen on the Fuze is amazing with the 480x640 resolution. Pictures and movies look great and text even when viewed very small is astoundingly crisp and clear. One of the best features about bout this phone is its excellent way in which it handles your emails. Extremely easy to view, access, and manage 3-4 email accounts. I use my Outlook Exchange, Gmail, and Yahoo on the phone and love the email management. The phone is very easy to cutomize to make it work and look the way you want it to.

However, I purchased 2 of them, one for home and another for work. I use them both daily.Prior to purchasing the charger/sync pods I had purchased an extended battery that lasted so long it never came close to running out of juice during the day, no matter what I used my Blackberry for. Unfortunately, the \"door\" for the back of the Storm that was included with the battery was so flimsy that it didn't last very long -- maybe 6 months or so. My only option was to purchase another extended battery (which I didn't need) just to get another flimsy door. I decided instead to reinsert my original (non-extended) battery with original (non-flimsy) door and get the 2 pods for easy recharge.I work in IT so the one at work just sits there at my desk. I keep the one at home on my nightstand by my alarm clock. So now, I keep my Storm easily recharged by inserting the phone into the pods when not in use. And I keep it in \"bedside\" (or \"clock\") mode so I have a nice clock to look at. At home I have a backup alarm (which I was using it for already). I can also activate the photo \"slide\" feature and have my Blackberry display my photos like one of those electronic picture frames. And best of all, the battery stays charged as if I have an extended battery just as conveniently.The only negative is that I must carry an extra charger for the car, but that's not really a fault of the pod, of course.The very nice design and convenience of this pod or dock is well-worth the small cost for the unit. You do have to purchase an additional wall charger for it (one doesn't come with the pod). This is a little inconvenient, but they are fairly easy to find and also super-inexpensive. Just make sure you buy an *actual* charger for the Storm and not a knock-off.

So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it's connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount.

I do a lot of cardio on the treadmill and the elliptical machines.  I haven't ran in them yet, but for my 60 min workout, they work pretty good.  Another gentleman at the gym had them, and I asked him how he liked his and he said they worked great, he even plays basket ball in them.  So I figured I'd give these a shot.They are light, seem to fit well.  They can be a little tight for people with larger heads, and I found that when I look straight up, or straight down, they kinda pull out from the ears, not a whole lot, but not a big deal either.  They seem to resist the sweat pretty well.I use them with my iPod Touch, and pairing was easy.  For some reason, when I have music playing right when they connect, the sound goes in and out for about 5 seconds, then, its steady music.  The volume controls work, but the pause/forward/back doesn't, but I find it easier to do that with the iPod anyway.  I have not tried to answer a call with my iPhone yet, but it paired with the iPhone 3G just fine also.These headphones do have a lot of bass, and here is what I found regarding audio quality.They come with 3 sets of rubber 'ear phones'.  They are initially equipped with the large.  I tried the small, but they go too far in the ear canal and the sound was very muddy (I listen to metal/rock/alternative such as Pantera, Janes Addiction, Depeche Mode, Crystal Method etc...) I went to the mediums, and it pulls the ear piece out enough to give excellent sound.  Though when I sweat, it seems to snug back down in the ear a little, so I think I might go back to the large earphones.  I also played with the EQ settings on the iPod and found the 'Rock' setting worked best for my taste in music (or lack there of depending how you look at it :) )  So before you frown on the audio quality, try out the different ear phones and see which work best for your music selection and activity.Like others have said, they have a non-user replaceable battery good for about 400 charges according to the manual.  But, the trade off is, no more wires and my iPod no longer goes shooting down the treadmill and onto the floor.Update (01/08/2011):Well, they are toast. The sweat got to them.  I will say though, probably my fault.  I should have taken the time to clean them up right after working out.  I imagine if you clean them up immediately after your work out they will last longer.  What I mean by \"cleaning up\" is, taking off the rubber ear phones and making sure all of the moisture is gone from the inside and the speaker portion itself.  I was just wiping them off, and calling it good.So, I may get another pair, or wait and see if a specific \"sport\" model comes out by someone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Was a nice pair of headphones...", "unixReviewTime": 1270252800, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2010"}

WhenMotorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphonescame out I jumped at the opportunity to buy them since they were the first stereo Bluetooth headset with a form factor that is appropriate for wearing in public. (Most of the other ones are too big and just scream \"Look at me, I am a dork!\") Unfortunately, those headphones had several limitations, the worst one of which is that they are not waterproof and after about a year of use they almost inevitably stop working. I had gone through three pairs of them thus far - I would have loved if I could buy alternate headphones, but in terms of features and the look these are still some of the best on the market. I have finally decided to upgrade to the slightly more expensive (and newer) S9-HD model and since I bought them a few weeks ago, I have been extremely satisfied with them - for the most part. Here are a few pros and cons that I have come up with.Pros:1. Comfortable enough for a daily workout. Even with my moderately large head, I did not have much of a comfort issue with wearing them every day for a couple of hours. I would not recommend wearing them for more than three hours in a row though. But that would be the case with most headphones anyways.2. Easy setup. I had no problem connecting them to either my cell phone/mp3 player or my laptop.3. Decent range. As long as there is an uninterrupted line of sight between the linking device and the headset, you can use them on the other side of a large room or a smaller gym. Comes in handy when working out and don't want anything attached to any part of your body.4. Decent music playback sound. This is one of the more noticeable areas of improvement over S9.5. Decent battery life. For a relatively small device like this one, it was pleasing to find out that it did not have to be recharged more than a couple of times a week with standard use.6. As a phone earpiece it is useful to have around the head headset because it improves stability a lot. All of my other earpieces fall out of my ears way too easily.7. Being transferred from the mp3 player to the phone when receiving an incoming call is really useful and cool. This works with iPhone as well.8. Improved and raised control buttons. They are much more accessible and not easily pushed by accident - this had been one of S9's weaknesses.9. Much improved earpieces - they are very comfortable and easier on your ears.10. The part of the headphones that touches your head is heavily rubberized. I hope this also means that these headphones are waterproof, or at least less likely to break down than S9.Cons:1. It would be really useful if these headphones were collapsible. In that case they could be taken with you in your pocket almost anywhere you go. Plus, it would avoid dangers of having them twisted while stored in your bag.2. The stereo feature works only for music. When using them for calling, only the left earpiece delivers sound, which is sort of weird. This takes some time to get used to.3. For some reason, when I linked them to my laptop, they got de-linked with my cell-phone. I had to go through the whole process again to have them back in the desired configuration.4. When using it with iPhone, the track-skipping buttons don't work.5. When using it with iPhone, the headphones don't work with all applications. This turned out to be annoying and inconvenient when I tried using them with Skype.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Noticeable Improvement Over S9", "unixReviewTime": 1283558400, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2010"}

I got both with this set, however I'm REALLY getting frustrated with the lack of consistency on the bluetooth connection.  Sometimes it is flawless and doesn't cut out, but typically that is only when I'm not on my bike.  Working out in the gym or around the house is fine, but for some reason when I start moving fast or biking with my phone in my pocket it just cuts in and out frequently.....which is a REAL buzz kill when you're in the groove!Also, there is no way to tell how much battery life is left on the set.  It will just stop working all of a sudden, which is also a buzz kill in mid-workout.The audio quality on the phone portion isn't really good either, but that's not why I bought them.  When listening to others it can sound like they are in a tunnel and they have said they same thing about my voice on their end.  I have a Jawbone Icon HD for talking to others, so this isn't a big deal to me, except when people call me in mid-workout.Overall they are a nice set to have, just be aware of the issues you may get when biking or running.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good audio quality, comfortable, but connection is spotty!", "unixReviewTime": 1339113600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2012"}

The Motorola S9-HD are superior to other behind the ear format BT headphones because the weight is not on your ears, the bulk of the device \"floats\" behind your neck.  This really makes a difference as far as daily use as they are very comfortable and convenient once you get used to the pressure of the headphones pushing into the sides of your head.  You DO get used to that.The sound is amazing, I listen to many genres of music but the music I listen to most has a lot of bass.  The bass response on both HD mode and NON-HD mode is amazing.  I usually have it on HD mode which drains teh battery faster but the sound is absolutley the best I have heard and rivals the quality of some much more expensive wired headhphones I have owned.The bluetooth connection is where these lose a star, it's just not possible to maintain the connection without maintaining line of sight communication.  I have noticed just today after owning the headphones since 11/11/10 and using them daily for several hours a day that the bluetooth connection has gotten even more tenuous.

Try to use them in a large fitness center or outdoors like for jogging, cycling, etc., and the audio cuts out about 3-4 times each minute. Apparently, the bluetooth receiver in this thing isn't very sensitive so it depends on walls to bounce the signal from your player to the headset. No walls = poor performance. At first I thought my first set was defective. But after getting a warranty replacement and experiencing the same problems, I read the instructions. (I know, I know). They explain that you should put your music player in a back pocket, preferably as high/close to the headset as you can. How dumb is that? I did find that if my music player is placed in line-of-sight within 6-8 inches of the headset, it works uninterrupted. I had a great deal of trouble jogging while holding my MP3 player behind my head.One more thing that really bugs me. Motorola outsourced its customer service jobs to outside the United States.

Proulx \"Up to my Neck in Tech\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Bluetooth headphones seem to be an unloved niche in R&D; departments. Although this is my only pair I've owned, I spent a fair amount of time researching other options, and none seemed nail the product. So, one has to settle, and I've settled for these.These do fairly well. When I first got them I tried them out in a variety of settings. I had a fair amount of cut-outs when paired with my computer. Watching my iPad across the kitchen also was hit or miss. Oddly enough the first few runs I did with these headphones resulted in the music cutting out several times. Now I mainly just run in these, but the cutting out seems to have disappeared. I hold my phone in my hand and I rarely have it cut out. The battery also lasts a couple weeks between charges (I only run 2-4 times a week). The SRS enhancement also is impressive. I have also had no problems with these malfunctioning due to sweat (I even ran with them in the rain last night).I have several complaints about these headphones though. Most importantly, and I couldn't find this anywhere else, I've noticed that the speed/pitch of your music will change when streaming over bluetooth. It sounds as though there is a slight buffering going on, and since the connection is worse at some times, it slows down and then catches up when it is better. While this effect certainly isn't exaggerated, it is noticeable and degrades the listening experience. I've also had this headset randomly skip tracks. The ear pieces are decent, however, they constantly make a clicking noise in my ears when I run since they aren't canal buds or headphones. They straddle this awkward middle ground. Finally, you cannot lie down on your back in these as is mentioned in other reviews (other than that, the fit isn't too uncomfortable, though they do hurt your ears at first)That all being said, I would probably still get them again. Not because they are good, but I am not convinced that there are really any better products out there that justify their price increase. It is a pleasure to run without wires, and these do a decent job. However, they certainly aren't without flaws. By the way, I ordered these over the newer model due to the price and the reviews on sound quality.So, if you need bluetooth headphones, unfortunately these may be your best options at this time. It seems like wireless audio transfer has a bit of growing up to do before this problem is solved. For now, I'll be sticking with these, and pretending like those key changes were intended.I hope this was helpful. Good luck in your decision.

Many years back, I bought theMotorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones. Eventually they wore out. The rubber came unglued and the volume would mysteriously increase on its own.Since I had used them pretty heavily, I wasn't completely surprised. But I liked them so much that I wanted a new pair. When looking to buy, I came across these, the S9-HD. Because these were the newest version, I went ahead and paid the extra $.Right away I noticed that the S9-HD was built more solid than the S9. The rubber seemed to be better attached, and the earphones fit in the ears more securely. Where I haven't used them as much as my old pair (do to lack of opportunity), I've had them since August of 2010 without any problems.Note that my main purpose for using these headphones is for music. They are hooked up to my MyTouch4G where I listen to mp3s and Pandora. I wanted something small that I could wear around the house without being weighed down--something that connected using Bluetooth and something that could easily be removed and hung around my neck. The only negative I have found with the design is that if you want to lay down (or lay back against something), the headphones get pushed away from the ears. So these can only really be used in standing and sitting situations. This is why I purchased theMotorola S805 Bluetooth 2.0 (DJ Style) Stereo Headphonesas well. When I want to watch a movie [when the wife and baby are sleeping] I simply put these ones on instead. They are big and awkward compared to the S9s (so, not as portable), but are perfect for laying down and watching a good flick (or playing the PS3).I have noticed that the sound quality during calls isn't so great, but I rarely use them for calls, so to me, that's a non-issue.
