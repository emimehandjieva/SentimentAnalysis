The truth is I prefer the other one, but people are different and it comes down to personal preference.What I love about this (and the other one from the same company), aside from the design and construction, is the fact that you do not replace the back cover of your phone with a part of a case like with other Galaxy Note 2 cases on the market. Another factor is value, which to me is what you get for the price. With this case or its sibling you get something to protect your expensive Note 2 at a very low price. And when you add in the attention paid to design and construction then the value becomes significant.Check out both models to find the case style that suits you.

Nothing serious because I was still able to go an entire day of moderate use without charging it. However I wanted to make sure that when it degraded to the point where I was getting mere hours instead of a day I had a fall back.When this arrived I stored the OEM battery and started using this one. It does not overheat when charging (or discharging) like some cheap knock-offs, and it has no trouble charging from my original Samsung wall charger or a few aftermarket chargers that I own.The discharge rate is similar to my Note II when it was new. And like that device's original battery this time next year I have no doubt that this one will start deteriorating because that seems to be the nature of Li-ion batteries after a number of charging cycles. At this price I feel as though I am getting my money's worth - and I still have the original battery in sufficient shape to take over if need be. frankly, this time next year I will be eligible for a phone upgrade and need not worry about this battery.I am more than happy with the price and performance.

Like every other bluetooth device I have used these need to be charged out of the box or they may not pair with your phone, PC or other bluetooth source. The initial charging took less than two hours and this headset with paired and connected to my Samsung Galaxy Note II within seconds. I also tested it with an iPhone 4S and it paired perfectly with that as well. I am not going to repeat the specs that are already in the product description.  I can affirm that they are accurate except that the playback time is not the 20 hours claimed. Mine ran out at the fifteen hour mark.Here are a few observations that may help you to decide if these are for you and the size is an important factor. I am going to cover the advertising claims:One size fits all - there are no adjustments for the behind the head band. I found the phones to fit perfectly, but folks with smaller heads may have problems with them staying on. My hat size is 6 7/8, and I would say that if your head is smaller than that you may want to pass these up.Sound quality is excellent. While these are not noise-canceling, the ear pieces do attenuate a certain amount of ambient noise and when I play music it's like having a private surround sound system. If you like music extra loud know that the volume will not go that high. Personally I have the volume set three quarters and it's plenty loud, even when I am using these phones to play my drums to a practice track.Controls are convenient once you remember their placement. I have uploaded a customer-supplied image that shows the layout.Since this headphone set has a built-in microphone you can use it to receive calls hand's free from your phone, as well as redial, and to use your voice dialing function if your phone is configured for it. I had a friend call me to test those features and I was able to hear the caller clearly and she had no trouble hearing me. Once I ended the call the music to which I was listening resumed from where it was paused when the incoming call was answered.My final test was to walk around my house with my smartphone stationary. Reception was perfect and the music I was playing streamed without interruption or degradation no matter how far away I was, including in my bathroom which has been problematic for some bluetooth receivers.Bottom line: this is an excellent set of phones that work also as a hand's free solution for phone calls. The sound quality is superb to my ears. The only caveat is to measure your hat size before purchasing this - if it's less than 6 7/8, you may want to consider an over the head model.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Excellent sound, but the size is not really adjustable","unixReviewTime":1386720000,"reviewTime":"2013-12-11T00:00:00"}

For the stress test I stretched one until it broke just to see how sturdy they are. It took a lot to break it, so the tensile strength of the elastic cord is relatively high. I do not know how many pounds it finally took, but I am betting over one hundred. Note: I pulled behind the wire loops on each end, so that part was not tested.For the functional use I attached this lanyard to one of this brand'sExtra Long XXL Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip Capacitive Stylus Pen, which is extra long and not well suited to shorter lanyards. I had no trouble using that pen tethered to this lanyard, even on the 10.1 inch tablet I employed as the test bed. I could easily reach any point on the tablet without interference of the lanyard itself.  I love the way that this lanyard uses a dust plug that fits into the 3.5mm port on my tablet. That is a clever design.Do note that if you are using a Samsung phone or tablet with an S-pen this lanyard will not work with it. I tested this on my Galaxy Note 3 using a third party stylus and there was more than enough room to move it around. However, there was no way to attach this to the S-pen, and that is normal because that stylus was designed to fit a hold in the phone itself, obviating the need for a lanyard.For me a dozen of these is a lifetime supply of lanyards. However, reading other reviews it's apparent that some folks go through lanyards quickly. If you are one of those, this package is a bargain because of not only price, but the fact that these lanyards are well made and should last a long time.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Well constructed and perfect for folks who need them","unixReviewTime":1396051200,"reviewTime":"2014-03-29T00:00:00"}

What threw me is the Connect button sits in a shallow recess that felt like it was an indicator light. Fortunately I am both technical and tenacious.

Please refer to my uploaded photos for visual reinforcement.(1) place 2 AAA batteries in the battery compartment.(2) move the On/Off switch to the left to place it in the on position.(3) go into your device's settings and find the bluetooth settings screen. Have it scan for new devices.(4) depress the Connect button on the back of the keyboard (it is to the right of the On/Off switch). You may need to use the tip of a ballpoint pen or similar object because the depression in which the button sits is small and shallow. My finger was too large to depress it without a ballpoint.(5) it will appear on your screen once it is paired. Next, tell your device to connect to it, then follow the onscreen instructions by entering the number displayed on your screen using the keyboard and pressing ENTER.I am so impressed that I am ordering one for my own phone.

For one thing, not all vehicles are going to be able to effectively provide 40 Watts through a lighter socket. This charging strip will intelligently distribute current in a manner that will protect your devices. Do note that most modern vehicles like my 2014 Outlander can, but my old 2008 Mazda 3 would have literally blown a fuse. This is not a problem with the charger, but advice to check the rated capacity of your vehicle's lighter socket before purchasing this strip.Another feature that I love is while each port can go to 2.1 volts, the internal circuit is intelligent enough to sense and adjust the charging rate for most devices.This is clearly designed for family use and it excels because five ports in such a small form factor is convenient. Many cars have lighter sockets in the center console as well as under the dash, and this plugged into the console socket is an ideal location for serving passengers in the back seat as well as the driver and front seat passenger. I did not bother to use the included velcro strip that attaches to the back of this unit and a smooth point in your vehicle with adhesive. However, if you want to secure it in a fixed location that strip is a nice bonus feature.Bottom line: this is the perfect solution for carpools, large families or even a single driver who carries around two phones, a tablet and sometimes a passenger who also has gadgets.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Pass the power, please","unixReviewTime":1399161600,"reviewTime":"2014-05-04T00:00:00"}

You can clearly see the grain, and it smells like the real thing too.Fit is perfect. All of the cutouts for buttons, cameras and charging connection fit as though Samsung designed this case.

Other cases I have tried has issues there.The main value is the protection, and it does a wonderful job. The plastic part into which you snap in the phone is sturdy and firmly holds the phone in place. The leather exterior provides some padding that takes the protection a step further, and the snap tab is non-magnetic, so your S-Pen is not going to act funny.I can fit a Florida driver's license and two standard size credit/debit cards in the the slots in the top flap without any problem (or adding bulk). The currency part will not take US bills unless they are folded because the wallet part is a few fractions of an inch too short.

The leather is first class and the plastic parts seem to be of equal quality. More importantly the slot for the credit card (the outside pouch will only hold one) fit every one I tried with no pushing or tugging. The wallet portion is good for six more cards and perhaps two or three US paper currency bills. As a side note the outside pouch will also accommodate a Florida driver's license.Fit to Phone: every button and the entire screen were easily accessible. The layout is perfect in that respect. Considering the number of cases my friend and I have tested this is one of the best for a glove-like fit that does not hamper phone functions or use. Note that if you have never tried a case like this one on an iPhone you will be disappointed by the way pictures turn out. This case is no exception - photos were a little fuzzy, but not because of this case's design. Every single brand and model case I have tested on the 4S exhibits this problem: without the case the photos are sharp and with a case they are slightly fuzzy.Best Uses: this case is perfect for any situation where the phone does not require maximum protection. Business use? Yes. Vigorous sports and similar activities? I would not use this case in those situations because the screen is flush with the outer edge of the case itself. In other words, there is no added protection if you were to drop the phone on a hard surface. However, this is not marketed as a maximum protection style case, but I wanted to set expectations in this review.One final thought: This case was not subjected to long term testing or use so the effect of the magnet in the wallet flap on encoded strips on credit cards and some ID cards is not apparent.

My testing was with a Samsung Galaxy Note II phone and an iPhone 4S, and I used the console aux lighter plug in a 2008 Mazda 3. I mention these factors because some reviews complained about slow or poor charging. Some of those issues can stem from the electrical source itself.For me I plugged my Note II into port 2, which is only rated at 1 amp and the iPhone into the 2.1 amp port. I took this approach because my Note II has a giant battery and I did not need to closely watch my battery consumption. Both devices charged up from about 90 percent to 100 on a 45 minute trip. The Galaxy was in constant use as an MP3 player and the iPhone was used by my passenger for texting and talking. No issues on either count.Physically this is the smallest charging port I own. On the plus side it is totally sealed, so there should be no issues with internal electrical deterioration, which is important in my area because of my proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. On the minus side, the internal fuse cannot be swapped out if it blows. That makes this disposable.I love the fact that it has an overload protection mode that shuts down the charger if overloaded. You reset it by simply unplugging it and replugging it. The two ports are rated at 2.1 and 1.0 amps respectively and according to my testing does, in fact, have a combined output of 3.1 amps. Do note that some USB devices will NOT work with this charger. I know that there are some models of Samsung tablets that will not, and you should make sure that your device will work with a standard micro USB adapter that has 12 volts at 1 amp input into the charger and 5 volts at either 1 or 2.1 amps out. This charger will support iPhone and iPad fast charging, and the iPhone claim was tested and passed in my evaluation.Other things I like are the way that the ports have sufficient separation to accommodate every cable I tried. Some dual chargers are so closely spaced that a thick USB end will sometimes block the use of a second cable.

Instead, I am going to list a few reasons why I love this phone, plus one big caveat. The caveat first: when I got my first smartphone - a Motorola Droid X - I was equally pleased at this point in the ownership cycle. At month 18 that phone became a nightmare. So, factor that in as I gush about how great this phone is.My comparisons are going to be to the Droid X:- I cannot believe the battery life! I am no longer tethered to a charger. One three hour phone conversation dropped my battery to 73 percent. And it charged back up to 100% when I did plug it into a charger in less than 20 minutes. Note: this is a relatively new phone with a new battery. I doubt I would get the same results a year from now when the battery is worn by numerous charging cycles. Still, since I routinely go the entire day without charging it, only putting it on charge when I go to bed, the wear and deterioration of the battery will probably be far less than for other phones.- Boot-up time is amazingly quick. My previous phone took what seemed to be forever to come up in a ready state after restarting it or powering it back on. This one does it in literally seconds.- Signal strength is as good, if not better, than the phone it replaced. That was a relief because I had heard horror stories about this and the S III. In fact, the Motorola phone was legendary for it's antenna and receiving/transmitting systems and this phone is certainly its equal.- Speaker volume and reception are vastly superior to the Motorola.I transferred my SD card directly from my Droid X to this phone and all of its contents were immediately recognized by the Note 2. I did have to recreate my play lists for my music, which may have been stored in the internal memory of the Droid X. Still, that was a relief to not have to recreate everything.Although this phone is supposed to be locked down I have added apps to it with no problems, so for me that aspect is not an issue.One accessory that I found to be essential to protect the phone is anEvecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 II N7100 - Black.As for the size - it is not a problem for me. In fact, I an getting older and the larger form factor - while not cool or trendy - suits me perfectly.The phone is, if anything, too responsive. The screen is sensitive to your every touch. Sometimes my finger lands or overlaps areas adjacent to where I wanted to touch and the phone responds before I can correct it. That is a minor issue and many folks will probably not experience it.Since this phone is practically a tablet I purchased anHDE Silver Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 Keyboard, which makes it super-easy to use for web surfing and creating and developing documents with Polaris Office 4.0 that shipped with my phone.If there is anything to complain about it's Verizon itself. I had to change from my unlimited data plan to their far more restrictive one in order to upgrade. I am not pleased about that and consider it to border on unethical. I've been with Verizon since 1999 and have been very loyal - until now. And since this reviews is about Verizon's version of this phone I think my comment about this is valid.On the iPhone vs. Galaxy comparisons: I have friends who have iPhones and they have admired my Note 2, but are not about to switch. I can see their point. They are comfortable with that device's interface and features and have no compelling reason to switch. I mention this because that comparison seems to frequently crop up and it truly has no relevance in my opinion. Most folks who are used to Apple are probably going to stay with that platform, and the newer ones seem to have close to the same features judging from one of my friend's 4S model.As I mentioned above, time will tell about this phone. Right now I am thoroughly pleased with mine, but who knows? Latent flaws could surface in the future that change my opinion. If so I will come back and update this review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Some quick notes after a month of owning this phone","unixReviewTime":1360713600,"reviewTime":"2013-02-13T00:00:00"}

While this is a decent charger in some respects, it falls short in other areas.First, the bad: this charger has a total output of 2.1 amps, so if you are charging two devices each will receive 1.05 amps. It will charge both, but it will take longer.In some cases one of the devices may not fully charge even after hours. Here is a real life example: I plugged my Samsung Galaxy Note II into port 1A (for non-Apple devices) and a friend plugged her iPhone 4S into the Apple port designated as 2A. I was actively using my Note II to stream music to my radio and simultaneously receiving directions from the GPS function. My Note II was at 85 percent when I started and two hours of constant charging later was at 97 percent. The iPhone 4S was not used on the trip and did fully charge. I own another charger that will provide the full 2.1 amps PER port and will quickly charge my Note II and my friend's 4S, so this is not the most capable charger on the market.At three inches in length it's on the long side. While it does fit the dash socket in my 2008 Mazda, it protrudes more than I like. My primary charger is a scant 1.5 inches long and is unobtrusive. One other thing is I could not open the fuse housing leading me to conclude that this is disposable - if the fuse blows the charger cannot be repaired. However, I have noticed a trend towards this design in some high-end chargers, including my favorite one so it's not a real detriment in my opinion.You can charge an iPhone in the non-Apple port, but even if it's the only device being charged the fast charge feature does not appear to work. That port will NOT charge an iPad though, so if you have an iPhone and iPad plug the latter into the Apple port and all will work (although the charge will be slower for each device.)There are some devices that this charger will not support, including the Asus Transformer and the Samsung Galaxy Tab model tablets.Bottom line: If you are not actively using your phone(s) for anything more than talking and some GPS use this is a decent charger for couples and friends who own an iPhone and an Android phone. It's relatively inexpensive, nicely constructed and does the job. However, if you are a power user who uses GPS, streaming music and other functions and have two phones plugged in you may want to look for a charger that can output 2.1 amps per port.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Falls short for some uses","unixReviewTime":1383523200,"reviewTime":"2013-11-04T00:00:00"}

I will attempt to highlight the reasons why I love this case/battery combo without repeating the excellent points made of other reviewers. My tests were made with an iPhone 5S.Foremost, this manages to provide effective protection and an extended battery in a compact package. It manages to keep the thickness of your iPhone 5S to a slim 15.5mm and less than doubles the weight (the 5S weighs about four ounces on its own and this adds another three ounces.)It's the way the protection actually works that is impressive. The back is padded, the case is sufficiently raised to protect the screen face, and the clever way it snaps in place all work to protect your phone. Compared to the sibling product -uNu Aero Series iPhone 5S Battery Case- that I also tested this one offers the best protection.Of course, back-up power is another top feature. The battery pack enclosed in this case is nearly  1.5 times the capacity of the built-in battery of the iPhone 5S, which easily doubles the use time of a fully charged phone plus this case/battery combo also fully charged.The devil is in the details: I also love the cut outs that are truly precision cut and placed. This case is a perfect fit over your phone. Plus you have the added advantage of charging with a more common micro USB cable, but if you want to use the Apple Lightning cable it's a simple matter to remove the iPhone 5S from this case and charge it with the native charging cable. Unlike some cases charging cables and data syncing work with the case on with every cable I tested.Some folks hate the recessed 3.5mm phone jack and the fact that you needed an extender cable to access it. The necessary cable is provided, but since do not use the phone jack (I prefer bluetooth) I have no issues with it. If you do use your phone jack you may not care for this aspect of the design.Overall, this is a well made case/battery combo that is functional, attractive and does exactly what the manufacturer promised - a rare combination.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Superb design and engineering","unixReviewTime":1388793600,"reviewTime":"2014-01-04T00:00:00"}

For me it's a convenience, but for folks who are emergency responders or who are preparing for an emergency this feature is critical. Another feature that makes this perfect for emergencies is the flashlight that is integrated into the case. It's not particularly powerful, but could make a difference in some situations. Of course, it's also a convenience for people like myself.It's large at 4 inches by approximately 3 inches and 7/8 inch thick. At ten thousand milliamp hours (mAh) capacity this battery has over three times the capacity of my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (3200 mAh) or an iPhone 4S and 5S, all of which were tested with this pack.While my Note 3 is relatively new and has ample battery capacity and remaining life, this charger pack made a difference with the iPhones, which are equipped with 1420 mAh batteries.  I also tested this with an iPad and it practically doubled the use of that device without a recharge.There is a micro USB port input for charging. You can use the cable that is provided or your own.  The two USB out ports are at different levels. One is rated at 1A and the other is 2.1A and can be used simultaneously. It also ships with an adapter cable with mini and micro USB ends, as well as an Apple 30 pin connector. For some reason this cable did not include an Apple Lightning adapter. It also ships with a nice, soft bag for storing it. Frankly, the velvet-style material is nice, but had it been waterproofed canvas or vinyl it would have been more in keeping with the best features of this pack - an emergency tool.Overall this is a great value for anyone who routinely uses both a phone and a tablet.

A few things you need to note:- If you are using a protective case for your phone (I am using aEvecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2) you need to remove your phone before you can clip on this lens.- This is a true fisheye lens that will capture a full 180 degrees.

This is a straight through lens with the fisheye effect as the only feature.- Your photos will be framed in what will look like a black mat over a porthole. Sort of like a spy shot, and also ultra cool for some unique views of wide areas.I am concerned that the clip extends over my screen on my phone. There is a soft plastic patch with a slight texture that holds the lens in place and seems to protect the lens from scratching.

The price is nominal considering the quality of the photos I have taken with this already. In fact, I have been able to shoot some interesting pictures. It's a shame that Amazon has eliminated the customer-supplied image feature because a few pictures are worth thousands of words.For the price you cannot go wrong.

I will admit up front that I was expecting yet another bluetooth speaker. I actually got much more - and in a sense less - than I expected. I'll get the 'less' part out of the way first. The sound quality is not as good as some of the bluetooth speakers I have tested. However it is not advertized nor pretending to be a high-end speaker. Sound is more than adequate when I am multi-tasking.What made me fall in love is not only does this allow me to connect from my phone and stream music, but also to play from my SD card. I have a few micro SD cards left from other phones when I upgraded card capacity, and they all have a lot of music on them. I had intended to wipe them and give them to a friend, but when I saw the SD card slot I tried it and that was the selling point for me. You do need an SD card adapter to use a micro SD card, which I had. Simply insert it and cycle the mode button to the SD card input and you will be playing music. There are controls that allow you to also skip tracks back or forward and a volume control.  The max capacity claimed for an SD card is 16GB, but mine worked fine with a 32GB card. You can also insert a flash  disk into the provided port.Do note that the micro USB port for powering this speaker is right above the SD card slot and it just barely clears with the included USB cable. I have a different cable with heavier ends that does not fit. This is not a show-stopper, but you should know about it.For bluetooth you press and hold down the mode button until you hear two beeps, when scan from your phone. This speaker will show up as FB Wireless and easily connects. It breaks up about twenty feet from the transmitting device (my phone in my case), but that is on par with some bluetooth receivers that I own.You can also switch this into FM radio mode via the mode button and receive stations in the 87.0 to 108.0 MHz range.It has an internal battery similar to a cell phone type that, according to the documentation, provides three hours of music play time. Of course when attached to the USB power source you can use this indefinitely.There is one final feature: you can directly connect this to any sound source via a 3.5mm cable (also included), so a PC or other device without bluetooth can still play through this speaker.For me this is the perfect companion. I have it in my enclosed patio for when I am enjoying a cup of coffee and the beauty of nature with Bill Evans or Mile Davis playing in the background.

If my comments seem out of whack with other reviews it's because of a glitch on the page.While the review sample I received is designed with foldable prongs for travel I use mine as a home solution. For me it's perfect because I have a bevy of speakers, cameras and other devices that all charge via USB ports, and the three 1 Amp ports in this charger are ideal for those because some devices will not work with chargers rated higher. The fourth port is rated at 2.4 and is ideal for my Samsung Tab 3 tablet.What makes this useful is I can simultaneously charge my tablet, phone and two other devices all at full speed. No one port or combination of ports diminishes the charging rate of the other ports. There is integrated circuitry that balances the charging rates, so there is no danger of overload.Although I use this as a home charger it's ideal for tourist travel where you have a camera, and more than one phone to charge if traveling with a family or companion. The prongs fold, and are polarity independent. What I mean by that is it can be plugged in upside down in a wall outlet, unlike many appliances and chargers that only go in one way.I love this unit so much that I am planning to purchase a few more for other rooms in the house.

While this review sample is not the highest capacity one I have tested, it surely stands out for looks and bonus features. Mine is the apple green model and the color alone draws attention (not to mention the form factor).There are some excellent reviews that cover the physical dimensions and bonus items. I will not repeat that information, but do recommend that you read Ali Julia's helpful January 1, 2014 review. I will concentrate on how the capacity of this battery relates to various popular devices and a few aspects that I like:To put the 6000mAh capacity into context consider the capacities of these common tablets and phones, and you can easily compute the added use time this battery will provide:*Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.* Apple iPhone 4S 1440mAh battery with about 6 hours of use time.* Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.* Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.* Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.I love the attention to quality, For example, the flat cable that ships with this battery is top-of-the-line in construction and is tangle free. It's intended to charge the battery, but you can also use it to charge any device that accepts a micro-USB connector by switching it to one of the two output ports.The instructions are also clear and honest. An example is the disclosure of harmful substances used in this battery and the compliance or non compliance to standards for safe levels. I will not recite the entire table (ask in a comment if you want to know full details), but the only substance that exceeds S/T 1363-2006 standards is lead (Pb).Operationally, this has a fast mode and an ultra-fast mode, depending on which port from which you charge your device, The fast port has a single lightning symbol and the ultra one has a double symbol. The instructions do not specify whether or not you can simultaneously charge two devices from the two ports, but this worked on my Galaxy Note 3 phone and an iPad at the same time. Since both devices were over seventy-five percent charged when I tested the dual charging I do not know what the actual charging rates are from each port.Overall, this is not only a cost effective way to augment your tablet or phone's stock capacity, but it's also a green way.

To be honest, it also has some features that had me scratching my head.I mentioned that this is a mid-range capacity pack. At 8000mAh, it provides sufficient back-up for moderate users who have both a smart phone and a tablet. I tested this with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and a Samsung Tab 3 10.1, and it extended their combined use times by a good three hours of heavy use. I rarely bother plugging the Note 3 into a pack because it does fine for me with its large internal battery,  but the Tab 3 is a bit power hungry and had I only plugged that into this pack it would have come close to probably four to five hours of extended use for that device alone.This pack also worked wonders with an iPad and iPhone 5S combination with which I tested it. The iPhone seems to drain rather quickly, but this easily increased that phone's use time by a factor of two - with time to spare.One of the best features of this pack is it displays the percentage of remaining charge to the nearest whole digit. No guessing with LED bars (on packs that even have them): you know at a glance how much battery charge is remaining at the push of a button.On the topic of buttons, the single button on this pack cycles through a flashlight, an infrared pointer and an ultraviolet light. Frankly, the UV light had me scratching my head, although scorpions glow green under them and we have an abundance of those around here. The flashlight is a nice convenience because the form factor is similar to a rectangular light, and the IR pointer is probably useful in a business setting. They are nice features, but to me not as important as the charge indicator or the dual port design of this pack.A final note. The rated capacity of 8000mAh may not mean much to non-technical folks who want a battery pack to extend their use time, but do not care about specs. Here are a few common phones and tablets and their internal battery capacities and normal use times. Use those figures to get a feel for how the capacity of this pack will extend the use time of your device:* Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.* Apple iPhone 4S 1440mAh battery with about 6 hours of use time.* Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.* Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.* Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.As you can see, this would more than double the capacity of a Tab 3 10.1 or increase that of an iPhone 5S more than five times. However, all packs have some loss, so, for example the Tab 3 would probably get another six to six and a half hours use, and the iPhone 5S would probably get around a thirty hour boost, depending on how you use the devices. Regardless, this is a convenience that works as advertised and can significantly extend the use time of your phone or tablet.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Outstanding basic powerpack with extras","unixReviewTime":1393632000,"reviewTime":"2014-03-01T00:00:00"}

I paid a small fortune for both my tablet and phone, so this set of features increases the value to me.While I literally had to read the instructions with a magnifying glass (a peril for we senior citizens) they were clear and contain information that would warm the heart of any geek. For one thing, there is a formula that every manufacturer should include with these. I will provide it at the bottom of this review because some folks hate math. I will say that the TRUE output capacity of this battery is about 6600mAh. Compare that to these numbers of actual device capacities and use times of some popular phones and tablets:Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.Even without using the formula it's easy to see how much extra use this pack adds. I mentioned in the title that this is excellent for first responders as well as power users (or campers, hikers, etc.) One feature is the large blue lit display that shows the percent remaining power. In an emergency that alone can make a difference by showing the time on scene of connected devices. The flashlight that is integrated into the case is another feature in that scenario. It's not particularly powerful, but could make a difference in some situations.The bottom line, though is the price. If you toss out everything I love about this pack it's still a value and that is the real reason I awarded it five stars.If you are interested in the formula I mentioned in the review:(battery supply voltage x battery capacity) x 0.9/battery output = the approximate output capacity.This accounts for losses through heat, wear and other factors (the 0.9 coefficient). Do not despair if this makes your eyes glaze. If you are shopping for a battery and want to compare, use it.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Perfect for tablet users and first responders","unixReviewTime":1395705600,"reviewTime":"2014-03-25T00:00:00"}

This is the latter and at around ten bucks is a bargain if you are using one of the more power hungry phones like the iPhone 5S.Using the iPhone 5S as an example the 2600mAh capacity that this battery has will add about 150% to the use time of an Apple iPhone 5S, which comes in at 1560mAh. Conversely, it will probably not add more than two extra hours to an Apple iPad 2's internal 6930mAh battery.The above estimates are conservative and account for power loss from temperature changes, repeated battery use and other factors. Out of the box in a stable environment this battery should perform much better than my conservative estimates.Lower capacity is not necessarily a detriment because it is a viable (and small)  emergency source that will easily fit in a purse or pocket. In that context even a tablet user will find that it can add just enough juice to make a difference for a critical task. My reasons for awarding this five stars are:VALUE: at the time of this review this pack was hovering in the ten to twelve buck range, which is the price of two fast food lunches. Considering that it does provide a lot of use time to some of the power hungry phones on the market it's definitely functional. Do not forget that this is perfect for cameras and other devices, so it's handy on vacations, hiking and beaches.CONSTRUCTION: it's practically indestructible, with no real moving parts (although the input and output ports are exposed).VERSATILE: the included cable has removable ends and includes mini and micro USB ends, plus an Apple 30 pin connector for all but Apple's newest phones. It also provides a mini barrel connector end for other devices like a bluetooth speaker I own. It's an all-in-one solution as long as you are not expecting the newer Apple Lightning cable.SIZE: it's fits purses and pockets as I mentioned, and is a functional keychain as well. True, the battery is a oblong block, but the size does make it easy to find misplaced keys.I am thoroughly pleased with mine for the reasons stated. If you are a constant tablet user you may want to consider the less portable, but higher capacityOXA Juice Box S2 10000mAh Safe External Batteryinstead.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Small and convenient","unixReviewTime":1397347200,"reviewTime":"2014-04-13T00:00:00"}

The documentation is a small fold out with small print, but easy-to-follow instructions. I had mine up and running literally within minutes of unboxing it.Connecting is as simple as plugging this into a power source - it comes with a very short and flimsy USB to micro USB adapter. I did not bother with it - I plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy Note II charging unit, switched it on, connected via bluetooth and started playing music. The sound is surprisingly rich with decent bottom end for an inexpensive speaker. Note that this also comes with a 3.5 cable that will connect a non-bluetooth device to the audio jack on the unit.While the sound impresses me, the distance I can be from this unit and still get a clear connection impresses me more. The specs say 10 meters. I took this outside (leaving my front door open) and it was still pumping out very clear music at well over 50 feet, nearly double the specs. I also took this into my master bathroom across the house and shielded by thick walls (the house is framed with blocks). Amazingly I got a strong signal. MyBelkin F8Z492TTP Bluetooth Music Receiversputters and dies when I do that connected to it.A few things that are cool now, but will probably get old in a hurry after the novelty wears off are the boot-up sound and the flashing light show synced to whatever music is playing. The boot-up sound is actually functional because it indicates that the unit is properly working and the fixed internal battery is properly charging. The light display in all of its multi-colored glory will probably start irritating me when I have this playing as I attempt to drift off to sleep with Billie Holiday serenading me. I do wish there was a way to turn that off.One feature that I especially love is the controls built into the top part of the speaker enclosure. You can actually skip tracks via bluetooth! I have not seen that feature elsewhere. There are also volume controls and the very top button allows you to mute and answer a call. That is assuming that you are next to the speaker. I have not tested what happens when an incoming call comes in, but will update this review if there are problems. I also intend to test this with my friend's iPhone. I expect that it will work as flawlessly as my Galaxy Note II, but I want to be as thorough as I can with this review.Wrapping up, this comes in a sturdy, gift quality box. Of course treating yourself to one of these is always an option, but they make excellent gifts as well and the packaging is perfect for that.I am thoroughly pleased with this speaker and although I got mine free had I paid for it I would still be very satisfied.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Impressive sound and even better than the specs","unixReviewTime":1375228800,"reviewTime":"2013-07-31T00:00:00"}

How wrong I was.Specs first: this charger has a fairly wide operating range of 10 to 16 volts DC for input and outputs 5 volts at 1 amp on the aux port and the cable (that is 1000 milliamps per the markings on the body). This easily charges my Samsung Galaxy Note II, which I connect to the cable and my friend's iPhone 4S (or her iPad when she brings it along) via the aux USB port. Each port outputs the 1000 mA, unlike some chargers that will split the output giving each device 500 mA. The micro USB end flawlessly inserts into my phone, which is something my previous charger did not. Indeed, the previous charger's micro USB plug has slightly distorted the phone's power port from poor tolerances.Right out of the box the first thing I looked for was the weak link in every other changer I've owned: the nut that holds the spring loaded tip and fuse assembly in place. On others the nut covers the entire barrel of the portion that plugs into the lighter socket and typically has coarse threads that will inevitably back off. When that happens the fuse, tip and spring will fly in different directions and this has happened more than once. Not so this. That assembly is housed in a separate assembly that is screwed into the body. It's practically impossible to come loose on its own, but still makes it relatively easy to change the fuse if ever you need to do that.The body of the device is solid and hefty. More importantly, it inserts and removes easily from my lighter socket, and the housing on the end for the second USB port is solid. In fact, the port is well designed and made because some ports - even on computers and other devices - require a little fumbling (and sometimes cursing) to insert the cable connector. This one does not exhibit that problem.Finally the cable, probably the most important part of this charger, isheavy-duty. In the past some of my chargers actually picked up my ignition system firing because of cheap cables and the fact that my car has a lot of radio frequency activity from the bluetooth connection to an FM retransmitter. This cable is ultra quiet and does not pick up external signals. If there is one complaint it's the cable is a tad too stiff. I have to exert a little more pull to extend it, but in the overall scheme of things that is a very minor complaint.Bottom line: this charger is a keeper and I am betting that it will long outlast the others that I have used - most of which fall apart of fail in some way after four to six months. This one is truly the Rolls-Royce of chargers.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Rolls-Royce of chargers","unixReviewTime":1378252800,"reviewTime":"2013-09-04T00:00:00"}

For my purposes this is an outstanding 'hedge' on a number of levels, but I want to get the caveats out of the way first.While this will work with an array of Apple and Android devices, including powered speakers, the instructions specifically exclude compatibility with Play Stations (PSP), the Blackberry, and Samsung tablets. If you have one of those this is NOT for you. Otherwise read on.This will work with most other 5 volt devices that require 1 or 2 amp power. There is an input on the bottom for attaching a micro USB connector for charging. I have successfully used my Samsung Galaxy Note II's charger and a generic one. I did not time my first charge out of the box, but am guessing that it took around four hours. Note that the instructions warn against using this to power a device while charging because it will shorten the service life of the battery pack.There is also a second port on the bottom of the battery pack for attaching an Apple USB cable to charge iPhones and other devices that require the 5 volt, 1 or 2 amp output with a standard USB end for the power source and whichever plug configuration works with the device's power in port. To be honest I use this port for my Galaxy Note II instead of the attached micro USB because I prefer a heavier cable. However, the built-in cable is a nice touch because in a true emergency the last thing you need to do is scramble around looking for a cable.I have tested this with my Galaxy Note II, which has extensive battery life (I can use it all day and still have some in reserve.) I also tested this with a friend's iPhone 4S. At 5000 milliamp hours (mAh) capacity this battery has about 40% more the capacity than my Samsung Galaxy Note II (3100 mAh). For the iPhone 4S it has over twice the capacity than the 1420 mAh battery in that phone. This provides a nice margin of back-up for those days when you are out and about and using your phone a lot. It's also perfect for emergency back-up while camping.There is a built-in flashlight that is relatively bright (especially in the dark). However it takes a little practice to turn it on and off: you need to press and hold the power button for a few seconds to cycle it on and off. I noticed that the battery heats up when you use the light so I personally would only use it in a dire emergency.Overall this is a handy - and very inexpensive - source of back-up power. I would not recommend routine using at to extend time for playing around because you will not only go through its reserve quickly, but will also probably reduce the service life. However, for a spare for important calls or sending a critical email on low battery or a true emergency this is cheap insurance.

In the past I used a two port lighter socket extender - one for the GOgroove and one for a two port USB charger. It was unwieldy at best.This solves the problem because it has two USB ports rated at 2.4 amps each for a total of 4.8 amps, plus a 15w socket for the GOgroove.

I do want to point out that although the contact tip unscrews, that part of the charger does not house the fuse. Overload protection is in the form of a red colored 10 amp blade fuse that is on the body of the charger.There are a few issues you need to factor in though:SIZE: this is a LARGE adapter.

If your car's lighter socket is not capable of providing the 4.8 amps total then you will not get the full benefit.

It's a tiny 4.5x3.5 inches and only 0.125 inches thick.The small size is deceptive because it packs 3100mAh, which is sufficient to double my use time on my Samsung Galaxy Note II. For iPhone users this pack will give you 2.18 times the capacity of your 1420mAh battery. How that translates into extra hours depends on your usage patterns. If you are currently getting 18 hours on a Galaxy Note II you can depend on at least 36 hours on it with this external power. It doubled a friend's normal six hours on her iPhone 4S.Aside from the small size and large capacity this battery pack is the only one (thus far) that I have evaluated and reviewed that allows you to simultaneously charge the unit while it's powering your phone or device. I must say that the claim of rapid charging is true. I literally watched my Galaxy Note II's battery percentage rise in mere minutes after plugging this in - it went from ninety five to one hundred percent in less than 15 minutes. Note that it was not being used at the time. I am sure it would have been slower had I been browsing the web or playing music. However, no other battery pack I have tested charged nearly as fast.The charging cord that comes with it is interesting. It's flat, no-tangle, but has very heavy duty strain reliefs on each end. One end is a standard USB and the other micro USB. On my Galaxy I can charge the pack up with this cable, then plug it into the output port and the micro USB end fits my phone. Or you can use whichever cable you choose.I normally do not discuss price in my reviews because they are subject to change. However I do want to note that at the time of this review this pack is significantly less than any other 3100mAh pack I have tested or reviewed.

The most distinguishing feature is it's designed for outdoors use. The attached cable serves double duty as waterproof covers for the charging ports. The body is impact resistant, and the form easily fits in a pocket or backpack pouch.Note that the charging cable that comes with this (it's the stripe along the edge of the battery in the product photos) has a regular USB and a micro USB connector that allows you to charge up the battery itself. If you own a device that accepts the micro USB end you can reverse the cable and use it to also charge your device. That works perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Otherwise you need to supply your own cable to plug into the USB port on this pack and into the charging port on your device.Even the capacity is perfect for outdoors use like emergency backup while camping, boating or other outside activities. Consider that the 6800 mAh capacity of the pack I have translates into:- Four and a half times of the capacity of an iPhone 4S or 5S (those batteries are 1,440 mAh)- Twice the capacity of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3's 3300 mAh battery- Over half the capacity of a fourth generation iPad's 11,560 mAh batteryIf you are purchasing the 3400 mAh model divide those numbers by two.I am very pleased with this battery and intend to keep mine plugged into my car's charger for emergency use when I am on long trips through rural areas.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Impressive capacity","unixReviewTime":1389052800,"reviewTime":"2014-01-07T00:00:00"}

The first thing that distinguishes this speaker from a pile of others that I have tested is this has a microphone for true hand's free operation.Since there are complete specs in the product description I will not repeat them here. Instead I'll highlight my experience and what I particularly like about this speaker. Out of the box I recommend charging it before tying to use it. Mine was shipped partially charged and it took about two hours to fully charge it.Pairing with bluetooth was simple: I turned the speaker on with a switch on the side, then pressed the multi-function button for about eight seconds until I got an alternating orange and blue light. I scanned for bluetooth devices on my Samsung Galaxy Note II and S113BT popped up. I selected that and was playing music as soon as it paired and connected.I tried the near field communication (NFC) pairing, but had to remove my Galaxy Note II from the case I use to accomplish that. Then the pairing popped up my S-voice application, so I abandoned that feature. I'll chalk that up to my phone's fault and my own inexperience with NFC.Sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small speaker. I always test speakers with Miles Davis' Kind of Blue because of the range of instruments exercise the full spectrum of sound. The bass response of this speaker is excellent, as is the mid and higher frequencies.Receiving phone calls is as simple as touching the multi-function button to receive an incoming call, which I pre-arranged for this evaluation. The person on the other end had no trouble hearing me clearly through the integrated mic, and I had no trouble clearly hearing her over the speakers.Overall this is a wonderful speaker that comes complete with a zippered case that actually protects it (it's waterproof), a charging cable and a 3.5mm cable to connect to headphone jacks if you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device. I normally donate my review samples after I evaluate them, but this one is a keeper.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Great sound in a small package","unixReviewTime":1383264000,"reviewTime":"2013-11-01T00:00:00"}

I want to first disclose upfront that I received a review sample.SOUND QUALITY: Excellent. My standard tests for speakers of any kind are are to play a few selected albums through it. I always start with Miles Davis'Kind Of Bluebecause it has high, mid and low range instrumentation. To my ears the album came through clear with all frequency bands distinct. Since that album contains only acoustic bass, I tried a few modern albums with heavy electric bass. To be honest some of the tracks I tried were a little thin, but considering the tiny speakers the sound was still impressive.CONSTRUCTION: I love the soft, rubber feel of the exterior of the speaker. I actually drop tested it to my carpeted floor from waist height and it did not affect it at all. Bottom line here is you can safely use this as an outdoors speaker - beach, hiking, etc. - without worrying about breaking it.FAVORITE FEATURES: I love the fact that I can insert a microSD card into the slot and play songs from it. I have a number of smaller cards with specific playlists, so that is a perfect feature for me. I tested a 32GB card and the device read it and played from it. You can cycle among connected bluetooth devices, directly connected devices via the 3.5mm port or tracks on your SD card with a push of a button.COMPATIBILITY: I tested this by streaming music from an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone and a Samsung Tab 3 tablet. I also streamed via bluetooth from my old Windows XP laptop via a bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle connected to my USB port. No problems pairing and connecting from any of the devices. Since I recently had a bad experience with a speaker that connected via 3.5mm ports I tested all of the above devices through their headphones out ports into the speaker. My bad experience with a different product involved a lot of static from certain devices, but this speaker was as clear as when connected via bluetooth or directly reading the SD card.Bottom line: this is a relatively inexpensive speaker with excellent sound and some nice features. I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Great sound, portable and even designed to withstand some knocks","unixReviewTime":1391731200,"reviewTime":"2014-02-07T00:00:00"}

That was the first impression and the cable continued to impress.That cloth colored jacket is not to give a cool, retro vibe, but has a valid electrical purpose. Most cables use PVC for the jacket and the dielectric properties will cause some signal distortion when they go through their store/discharge cycle. Granted, the amount of charge a PVC jacket will store and eventually discharge is minute and also will not affect charging. However, many of us use our cables to sync to laptops and other devices and with the cloth jacket this effect is so minimized as to be nominal.I love the heavy duty housing for the connectors and how they manage to be both thin enough to be unobtrusive and substantial enough to assure a long service life. There is even strain reliefs on each end of the cable to minimize wear that can eventually cause diminished transmission at the weak points in any USB cable. Whoever designed this cable thought of everything.Finally, the ends mate perfectly with every device with which I've tried them: on the micro end my Galaxy Note II, a friend's Droid, and a plethora of speakers and ear buds. On the USB end this cable fit my laptop, my Acer netbook and chargers and charger ports. Not too tight like other cables, and always the perfect fit with the slight resistance that indicates a plug built to exacting tolerances.Usually when I receive review samples from manufacturers I test and review, then give the product to less fortunate folks.

What it is, though, is a cool keychain that can give your phone or other device a boost if it runs out of juice. And it's small enough to work as a keychain as long as you are the sort who wants one that has a relatively large block of plastic attached. Some folks do like chains like that because it makes it easy to find misplaced keys.At 2600mAh, this will more than double the use time of an Apple iPhone 5S, which comes in at 1560mAh, but will probably not add more than two extra hours to an Apple iPad 2's internal 6930mAh battery. Still, it may add just enough to make a difference for a critical task.I love the charging cable that has removable ends and includes mini and micro USB ends, plus an Apple 30 pin connector for all but Apple's newest phones. It also provides a mini barrel connector end for other devices (I have a speaker that is powered through a barrel connector that this one fits perfectly.)There are a few areas that would make this battery pack a better deal. First, is the lanyard with the keyring. It looks and feels strong, and was intelligently designed to allow the battery to hang clear of a steering column when your car key is in use. I do think it could be a little beefier though. Another improvement I would love to see is a built-in flashlight like some battery packs have. That would increase the functionality significantly because many folks already have a small light attached to their keychains.As long as you know up front that this is more of an emergency charge than a primary battery pack this is a bargain.

My review is based on prior experience with sports armbands and I will focus on that comparison.I received a review sample and had a ready point of comparison: a Mobile Maiden XXL Smartphone Workout Armband. That band had a few limitations for newer phones, but this one takes the design of a sports armband to a whole new level.First, this works with the larger phones. My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 fit, as did my Note 2. If you have a smaller phone, though, it may actually get a little lost in the ample pouch. Physically the inside dimensions of the pouch are 7.75 by 3,75 inches (although the top has slightly rounded corners that will take off about an eight of an inch.) Until someone comes out with a phone larger than the Note 3 this is the pouch to get for large smartphones.Second, the armband is heavy duty in every way: the thick, clear face will protect the phone while allowing you to still use your fingers to control all screen functions, and the padded arm strap and case construction are a giant leap over the Mobile Maiden armband to which I am comparing this one. Sound quality is superb even in the heavy case, and the protection that the design affords makes this perfect for strenuous activities. Having your phone enclosed in a zippered case versus one that has a slot to insert your phone is another level of protection that earns this one five stars in my opinion.The bottom line is this is perfect for large smartphones up to the biggest on the market at the time of this review. The protection is the best I have come across and it's comfortable to wear.

This was tested with a Samsung Galaxy Note II at 50 percent, an iPad and iPhone 4S at about the same levels, and two brand new 2400mAh battery packs out of the box. The Note II and both Apple devices fully charged in about the same time it would have taken using their OEM chargers, and the battery packs were fully charged in less than an hour.I've reviews more than my share of multi-port chargers and have never seen results like this. More importantly the body of the unit did not get hot (or even moderately warm.) While I loved the fact that this will fully charge five devices at once, I especially like the fact that the design includes electrical protection for over voltage and current, and short circuits.Another thing I appreciate is all of the ports are marked for specific brands, but also can double as universal ports. I have other multi-port chargers that have Apple specific ports, but it was never clear that I could use them for other devices. On this one every port will work with practically any 1A or 2A device except the Samsung port that will not work with an iPad.There are two 1A ports, plus three 2A ports (two for iPads and iPhones or universal and one for Samsung tablets).Physically this is a large unit at over 4.5x2.5 and 1.18 inches. However, it's not a wall wart because it has a heavy-duty cable that is just a tad short of five feet long. For me the size does not detract from this charger because it's easy to tuck out of the way.

And it does so with some built-in electrical protections that many other chargers that I have tested lack.

First, I will try to avoid repeating Daisy S' excellent January 15, 2014 review and focus on my experience with this type of speaker in general.Key strengths of this one include:SOUND QUALITY: the speaker holds up over a wide range of frequencies. I tested a few albums, like Miles Davis'Kind Of Blue, which has low, mid and upper register instruments in the mix and the reproduction of the sound was superb. I could easily hear Paul Chambers' bass all the way up to Jimmy Cobb's ride cymbal (and all of the other instruments).DISTANCE: some competing speakers start to break up as you approach the 10 meter mark away from them. This one maintained an exceptionally strong signal slightly over that limit, then the sound quality gradually degraded for another meter before starting to break up. While the product description says this will not receive through walls it will. I was able to get a clear signal at five meters two rooms away. In engineering that is called 'robust'.I loved the aux out port on this. I was able to pipe the signal into a 3.5mm input on aPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA System, effectively using this speaker as a bluetooth receiver and it passed the signal through without distortion. Of course, you can also use the aux in port for non-bluetooth devices, so this speaker is versatile.Before jumping on this one, though, check out its sibling, theEasyAcc 2nd Gen Olive Bluetooth Speaker with Built-in microphone, which is basically the same device, but with flash card and SD card support.

It worked perfectly and had some surprisingly nice features, but had some glaring flaws as well.I'll get the flaws out of the way first. Topping the list is the instructions, which bear no relation to the product itself. If you are not familiar with battery chargers such as this one I recommend getting a different model because you will think something is wrong with this one if you go by the instructions. Specifically, there are no multiple LEDs, nor is there a switch that my instructions referenced.A second issue is not knowing whether or not this is fully charged. There are no indicators of that either. I will say that this fully charged after I left it plugged into a generic USB charger for eight hours.If you are experienced with chargers of this type you can ignore the first issue and when you consider the incredibly low price point - less than ten bucks at the time of this review - you can forgive the second.What pleasantly surprised me is the cable that ships with various adapters: a mini and micro USB connector, an Apple 30-pin and a barrel plug. I actually have a speaker that uses the latter, but frankly the lack of a newer Apple lightning adapter is a glaring omission.The rated capacity is impressive. The 2600 mAh that this charger provides breaks down into the following ratios:- 180 percent of the capacity of an iPhone 4S or 5S (those batteries are 1,440 mAh)- Approximately 70 percent of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3's 3300 mAh battery- 25 percent of a fourth generation iPad's 11,560 mAh batteryIf the manufacturer reworks the documentation this will easily be a five star product based on the price point and fact that it works per specs. Of course it's nice to also have charging indicators, but I am sure that would raise the price to where this charger would lose some of its competitive advantage. The bottom line is you cannot go wrong by shelling out ten bucks for one of these.","overall":4.0,"summary":"A barigain for battery packs, but has some issues","unixReviewTime":1389052800,"reviewTime":"2014-01-07T00:00:00"}

I choose her because since I received this for free I wanted to make sure I was not biased.  Here is why I said that this is perfect:(1) Every other case - and there were many - I have tried, including ones without the built in battery pack caused issues with the camera. There was always a shadow or reflection that marred them. This case does not cause that problem. So a big plus here.(2) This battery pack is charged via a micro USB port. Not a big deal if you always have an iPhone cable with you, but if your friends own Android or Windows phones chances are that their device charges with the micro USB. Now you can charge up with their adapters in a pinch.(3) The battery doubles your total use time because at the rated capacity of 1420mAh, the same as your iPhone 4S battery, you have doubled your capacity the minute you plug your phone in.The case itself is not heavy-duty protection. It will protect your iPhone from minor bumps, but I doubt anything more than that. A few good points is the smoked plastic piece that fits over your phone is slightly raised above the screen. Plus the back part of the case is very heavy duty, but for some reason phones seem to fall face down.Installing your phone is a snap (no pun intended). You remove the plastic upper piece (it takes some gentle prying), slip your phone into the main body where your charging port will mate with an Apple-style one, and snap the upper piece in place.All buttons are perfectly accessible and the camera works as mentioned above. This comes with a heavy duty (albeit short) micro USB cable and a charger. And if you want to charge just your phone of course you can remove it from the pack/case combo and charge it with your regular iPhone charger.One final note: the packaging is also well thought out.

At 12000 mAh this will more than double the use time of an iPad's 11,666 mAh battery. To put the capacity of this pack into perspective here are a few other devices with which I tested this pack and how much this pack extends their use time:- Samsung Galaxy Note II has a battery rated at 3100 mAh and this pack provides 3.9 times that capacity (I did not have a newer Galaxy Note 3 that is rated at 3450mAh, but the math shows that this pack provides roughly three and a half times that capacity.)- iPhone 4S has a battery rated at 1420mAh and this pack provides a little less than eight and a half times the effective use time.So, while this is a giant among battery packs the power it provides is also a giant.

I enlisted the assistance of a friend who has a 5C to test this. Like others have noted the lightning connector end did not fit the charging port cutout on a bumper style case, but the connector itself fit the port perfectly once the phone was removed from the case.As soon as you plug this into a charger the ring on the lightning end flashes a second, then turns solid blue. While charging the ring will flash red, then return to solid blue once the phone is fully charged. On the 5C the phone was verified to be 100% charged when the indicator returned to blue. The test phone was relatively new, so the battery had not begun its gradual deterioration that happens to every battery regardless of phone or tablet brand. That may account for the disparity between my results and the one reported in the excellent and helpful December 9, 2013 review posted by buru buru piggu.The cable is a bit short at three feet, but well constructed. The lightning connector end is the culprit that prevents this cable from plugging into most cases and certainly the one on the phone with which this was tested.

The 3-D effect is made all the more realistic because of the convex shape and the soft feel.

Not only does this significantly increase the battery capacity of an iPhone 5 or 5S, but the case affords more protection than other cases I have tested. This system was tested with an iPhone 5S.Here are the key features and advantages as I see them:EXTENDS CAPACITY: While the packaging indicates that this will double the use time of an iPhone 5 and provide 85 percent more for the 5S, the actual results are a little better than claimed. For the iPhone 5 the battery pack provides 138% more use time and for the 5S the figure is 127%. This is based on the fact that this battery pack adds 2000mAh (milliamps per hour) to the 1440mAh that the iPhone 5's battery has, and the same addition to the 1570mHa for the 5S.Note that increasing battery capacity increases use time, which is completely dependent upon how you use your phone. If you normally get ten hours between charges, with this battery you will at the very least double that for an iPhone 5 and add another minimum of 8.5 hours to a 5S. Those are conservative numbers that go along with the manufacturer's claims. In practice you will get more with a newer phone since the battery has not deteriorated from multiple charging cycles.FIT AND PROTECTION: The battery assembly is also a protective case with a soft synthetic back that cushions and absorbs shock. All of the cutouts are perfectly placed and all buttons and ports are available with the battery in place.Do note that the case is a two piece assemble that consists of a back (battery) and bumper that you snap in place after you mate your phone with the lightning connector. Once your phone is encased you will charge the battery with a standard micro USB cable (one is provided with this battery). This has pros and cons. On the plus side you can ditch the proprietary cable the iPhone 5/5S uses; on the minus side any investment you have made in extra lightning cables is negated.You can charge and transfer data simultaneously, which is a feature that sets this battery apart from the competition. Plus you can charge it via a computer's USB port. Not all batteries on the market will allow that - many I have tested would not charge that way.CHARGING MAT: An added bonus is the wireless charging mat that is included with this battery. It actually does work (I was a bit skeptical at first). In fact, it will charge up the external battery pack in almost the same time it takes to charge it via the micro USB connection from a regular charger. This adds not only convenience, but value because some of the iPhone batteries I have tested in the past were in this one's price range and did not include a charging mat.Overall this is a solution that is superbly engineered and manufactured. Everything from the precision fit of the battery case to the way this solution performs to or exceeds claimed specifications warrants a solid five stars.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Outstanding engineering","unixReviewTime":1387670400,"reviewTime":"2013-12-22T00:00:00"}

So a big plus to Bolse for designing a multi-port charger in a form factor that will fit even the most cramped space.The ports are sufficiently spaced to allow me to insert three very heavy-duty USB connectors with wiggle room to spare (albeit, not much). I use these cables to test multi-port chargers and hubs because in many cases they are too large to fit tightly spaced adjacent ports. Surprisingly all three fit into the charger.At first I was peeved that this charger did not provide access to an internal fuse (the body is solid). Upon reflection I am not sure that is an important feature on modern charging systems. I cannot recall the last time I actually replaced a fuse in a charger, but I have vivid memories of cheaply made ones coming loose at the threaded section that housed fuses. I think I like this design better than the old style. A further advantage is I spend a lot of time on the Atlantic coast and the salt air rapidly deteriorates electrical and electronic gear.

Dimensions are 6 by 1.75 inches and 2 inches tall. The controls are easily accessible and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.I performed my usual tests against the specs. I got a little over seven and a half hours running it from the internal battery, which is in the ballpark of what the specs claim. I was able to easily maintain a signal from my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 from thirty feet away, so that claim is valid. I can also confirm that it also works hand's free.Note that if you want to crank up your tunes this speaker does not get super loud. It's more of a personal speaker. You can also use it to power non-bluetooth devices via the 3.5mm connector (and a 3.5mm cable is provided in the package). I tried it out on my laptop and it made a world of difference.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Small and powerful - nice bass!","unixReviewTime":1386979200,"reviewTime":"2013-12-14T00:00:00"}

I will provide my take on this battery and some of the reasons why I rated it so highly.There are two trends happening in the portable battery market: (1) high capacity for power users and (2) smaller, low capacity models for when you are low on charge and need a convenient and portable battery pack. This is the latter and at around ten bucks is a bargain if you are using one of the more power hungry phones like the iPhone 5S.In fact, at 2600mAh, this will add about 150% to the use time of an Apple iPhone 5S, which comes in at 1560mAh. On the other hand it will probably not add more than two extra hours to an Apple iPad 2's internal 6930mAh battery. I am basing my estimates on worst case scenarios where there is power loss from temperature changes, repeated battery use and other factors. Out of the box in a stable environment this battery should perform much better than my conservative estimates.Think of it as an emergency source that will easily fit in a purse or pocket. In that context even a tablet user will find that it can add just enough juice to make a difference for a critical task.My reasons for awarding this five stars are:- price versus value: at the time of this review this pack was hovering in the ten to twelve buck range, which is the price of two fast food lunches. Considering that it does provide a lot of use time to some of the power hungry phones on the market it's definitely functional. Do not forget that this is perfect for cameras and other devices, so it's handy on vacations, hiking and beaches.- solid construction: it's practically indestructible, with no real moving parts (although the input and output ports are exposed).- charging cable  has removable ends and includes mini and micro USB ends, plus an Apple 30 pin connector for all but Apple's newest phones. It also provides a mini barrel connector end for other devices like a bluetooth speaker I own. It's an all-in-one solution as long as you are not expecting the newer Apple Lightning cable.- size: it's fits purses and pockets as I mentioned, and is a functional keychain as well. True, the battery is a oblong block, but the size does make it easy to find misplaced keys.I am thoroughly pleased with mine for the reasons stated. If you are a constant tablet user you may want to consider the less portable, but higher capacityOXA Juice Box S2 10000mAh Safe External Batteryinstead.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Convenient and portable","unixReviewTime":1395705600,"reviewTime":"2014-03-25T00:00:00"}

It does have some heft, but has some nice features like a light bar that indicates remaining capacity and an integrated flashlight.When it comes to overall capacity this would have been a big deal this time last year, but is a bit anemic by today's standards. Of course, the price is far less than it would have been a year ago, so that's progress. Most of us need a little extra power from time to time, and this is all most of us need.When I evaluate batteries I take the rated capacity and multiply it by .9 to obtain a more realistic figure. Temperature changes, the age of the battery itself and losses during charging operations all eat away at the rated capacity, so calling this 5600mAh battery 5040mAh sets expectations to a more realistic level. It will still charge a power hungry iPhone 5S over 3.2 times of that device's normal 1560mAh capacity, which quadruples its use time. Yes, there are bigger batteries on the market, with correspondingly bigger form factors and price tags. For me this one is good enough.For tablet users, this is still not a bad deal when you consider that this will add about seven and a half hours to the 10.5 hours of use time a stock iPad 2 gets with its internal 6930mAh battery. Even my power hungry Samsung Tab 3 10.1 gets an extra 5 or so hours added to its seven hour use time from that tablet's internal 6800mAh battery.  The bottom line here is this may not be the biggest and baddest battery on the market, but for most of us it gets the job done.About the only possible issue with this battery is the slower charging rate. Its input and output ports are rated at 1 Amp, which will charge just about any device on the market, albeit more slowly than the fast charging models that are on the market. Plus, this has a single output port, compared to two or more on contemporary models. For single devices like a phone this is not an issue, and considering the small size and price tag it's a benefit.  I test a lot of battery packs and this one can easily hold its own in the niche it occupies. To me it's an easy five stars and a value when you consider the price/performance ratio.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Compact, low-to-mid range battery with extras","unixReviewTime":1395964800,"reviewTime":"2014-03-28T00:00:00"}

When I discovered this case I had to have one and am thrilled with it because it does everything I want.Foremost, it protects the screen because the case's bumper is slightly raised and there is a protective screen that provides another layer of protection. This is a two piece case plus a plastic holster that clips to a belt. The holster provides yet another layer of protection because the phone clips screen side into the casing of that component.The next layer of protection comes from the hard plastic inner case that has a soft, cushioning layer of material where your phone's battery cover contacts the surface of this case, and an outer cushion of neoprene-like material that will absorb some shock.All of the phone's functions are easily accessible, and the total area of the screen can be used, Even the S-Pen can be accessed, so this will not hamper normal phone operation.The protective screen is not as crystal clear as I would like, but I'll easily trade that for the protection that it provides. Believe me, if you ever crack a screen on a phone you will be willing to accept some compromises when it comes to protecting the screen on your next phone.While this is not waterproof, it will keep some moisture out as well as dust. The major feature, though, is protection in more hostile environments and this case provides that exceptionally well.

This is perfect for emergency responders and folks who want an emergency power source when camping or hiking.What impresses me most is this is actually waterproof. I put it to the test by leaving it submerged in two feet of water for an hour after charging it. The cover seal kept the charging ports bone dry and the device worked per specs after the bath.  Moreover, when I turned on the SOS light (a white beam of light just bright enough to be seen) and the red pointer light both of those worked submerged.Another feature is the color. The contrasting black and orange make it easy to spot if dropped on a beach, in the woods or similar environments. The case has two loops to attach a lanyard, and has a neoprene outer skin that protects it against shock. In other words, it's evident that some thought about using this in harsh or emergency environments was put into the design.At 5200mAh this is less than twice the 3200mAh of my Galaxy Note 3 phone, but three times the capacity of an iPhone 5S. As a general purpose battery extender the capacity is not remarkable. However, as an emergency source it is more than sufficient.The value of this battery lies in its design to withstand harsh environments more than as a convenient way to extend your device's use time.

Let me say up front that there is a trade-off, but one I am glad to make: this takes the sleek 5S and adds a little extra size to it. Width wise the increase is nominal as is the weight. It does make it about a half inch taller, so if you love the phone's original size this will detract slightly from the aesthetics.Looks aren't everything, though, because use time is more important to me and I am not always around a charger. The 2300mAh capacity of the integrated battery is almost 1.5 times that of the 5S' internal 1560mAh battery. Even accounting for loss from charging that is still twice the use time of a 5S without this case, which is why I love it.Another feature I love is the way the case protects the phone. While Apple builds their phones to withstand a lot of abuse, this case adds another layer of protection. It is shock resistant, and the way the outer lip is slightly raised gives the screen more protection if you drop the phone in a carpeted office.Others have described how this case works and fit and form, so I am not going to repeat that information. I will say that the final selling point for me is this case earned Apple's MFi (Made for iPhone) certification, which gives me peace of mind. There are too many products on the market that are of shoddy quality or from fly-by-night outfits, so the certification is not only meaningful, but worth a premium price to me.

The review sample that I received of this one is priced lower than all that I have previously tested without compromising quality. There is only one trade-off and that is this will increase the size and weight of your 5S. There are models that are sleeker, but they cost twice as much (at the time of this review) and do the same thing.Since there are some excellent reviews already, as well as detailed specs, I will spare you a regurgitation. Here is why I love this case and gave it five stars. First, price. At about forty bucks at the time of this review this one is priced in the same range as a fancy leather case that may look good, but does little more. Of course ease of use and a good fit are important, and this one has both of those qualities.Another significant feature is this truly does protect your 5S. The bumper is slightly raised above the screen, and the back and sides of the case will afford more than just basic protection in most office environments. Dropping your phone outside in gravel is another story, but to the best of my knowledge there is no brand of case plus battery that will protect against that.There are other nice touches, like a pigtail that allows you to access the 3.5mm port on your phone. This is important if you use that port for headphones because just about all cases for the 5S hider access to it. The pigtail that's included is specially designed to provide a way to connect to the port through this case.I will not belabor the advantages of the battery pack or ability to charge your phone while synching through this case. I will reiterate though that this is a value priced case that does both of those tasks well. The only real trade-off is weight and size increase.

There is a heavy duty screen protector that covers your phone's screen, but you can still perform any function as though there was no added layer of protection.It's the layers of protection that earn this case (in my opinion) five stars despite the poor instructions. Your phone is encased in a hard case, which is - in turn - encased in a heavy neoprene case, then affixed to a belt holder. I did not dare drop test a phone because I was using a friend's, but if I were a betting man I would put money on a phone surviving a fall on a hard surface if protected by this case.All buttons and features are perfectly accessible and function without problems or obstructions.This is overkill for business and office workers, but for construction and first responders, or anyone else in a profession that takes them into such areas, this is ideal.

The main charging cable has that connector, although there is a second, regular USB port that will accept any charging cable with one end that is compatible and the business end adapted for any other port. That means that the Lightning or 30-pin connector on your iPhone or iPad cable (or just about any other cable on the market) will work in that port.The coiled cable that is integrated into this charger is heavy-duty and will stretch from its normal 16 inch length to three feet without unduly straining it.I love the value, which is based on some surprisingly advanced features for a charger at this price point. Most chargers I test with the newer style internal protection go for two times the cost of this one (which is less than ten bucks at the time of this review). This charger does not employ the old style fuse that lower end chargers use. This one is a sealed unit with protection against over current and over loading. It has a dual charging circuit that simultaneously delivers a full 1 Amp via the micro USB cable, but 2.1 Amps via the universal USB port.Another feature is the elimination of electromagnetic interference. This is a problem in cheaper chargers and cables because your ignition system radiates some interference that lower quality cables and chargers pick up. If you are making phone calls or streaming music from your device that can be maddening. The independent charging circuits that prevent this is one of the main reasons I cited this as having value (and awarding it five stars).Bottom line: this is a well designed and made charger that is value-priced.

The tablet ports are 2.4 Amps, which is slightly higher than the premium charger to which I am comparing this (email me for the brand and model if you are interested). So, for tablets this will charge noticeably faster and my tests with both an iPad and a Samsung Tab 3 10.1 proved that because I clocked both at 75% to full charge on both chargers.

It will fast charge tablets, which is an improvement over some of the plodding chargers I have in the house, and it does provide the most basic level of circuit protection.

You are rewarded with a brief indication on the display when you do have the pins lined up, but to be honest, I get it about fifty percent of the time, and fumble in frustration the other fifty percent of my attempts.

Even if you follow the directions to a T you need to be lucky with the time when you 'lightly press' the B button. Speaking of which, perhaps a small middle button specifically for pairing would solve that issue. Or, if there is enough remaining electronic real estate on the circuit board, employ the newer style bluetooth that makes itself known to scanning devices automatically.

The earlier generations of speakers that I own required you to remember how long to press and hold a multi-function button to turn it on, off and to connect to a bluetooth enabled device. In some cases I think chanting was involved, but this one is refreshingly different. You turn it on and off with a switch on the bottom and the buttons, such as they are, work without knowing magic sequences. My speaker came up broadcasting its presence, which my phone immediately detected when I initiated a scan. It connected and within mere minutes of unboxing this thing I was streaming music to it. Granted I broke the cardinal rule of charging it first, but I did connect the included charging cable to my Galaxy Note 3's wall charger.Sound is the biggest surprise.

I multiply their rated capacity by .9 to account for losses due to temperature changes, heat and the charging process itself. That makes this 8000mAh battery a more realistic 6480mAh. This disagrees with another reviewer's numbers here, so for this review I will split the difference and use .8 as the coefficient, which yields 6400mAh. Even with that conservative figure you can still expect the following increases of use time over and above the published times for the following common devices. By 'use time' I mean using both phone and web functions:* Samsung Tab 3 10.1 with a stock 6800mAh battery provides approximately 7 hours use time. With this battery you can extend it by another 6 to 6.5 hours.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with a stock 3300mAh battery provides approximately 6 hours use time. With this battery you can extend it by another 11 to 12 hours.* Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh battery provides approximately 8 hours use time. With this battery you can extend it by another 28 to 32 hours.* Apple iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery provides approximately 10.5 hours use time. With this battery you can extend it by another 9 to 11 hours.Numbers are not everything. I have tested a number of OXA products - and not just batteries - and have been impressed with their quality. Perhaps more importantly, the reliability makes this a great value. While I have not owned this specific battery long enough to proclaim that it is reliable, I own other OXA models of varying capacities, some of which have been in constant use for over six months, and all of which have been completely reliable.One final note is the size of these mid-range capacity batteries is shrinking and this one is not the brick the earlier generation of batteries in this range were. In addition to the form factor shrinking, the prices per mAh are as well, and this one is a value for the amount of extra capacity it provides - even after applying a coefficient to obtain a real world capacity.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Value-priced extended battery solution","unixReviewTime":1397001600,"reviewTime":"2014-04-09T00:00:00"}

I will focus on subjective reasons why I love this case and try to not parrot what others have already said.I carefully examined and tested my review sample. At the core of this product is the battery, which is an impressive engineering feat because the manufacturer managed to achieve respectable power storage with very light weight.It at least doubles your use time by adding 2400 mAh to your phone's 1420 mAh. Even factoring in heat and other losses you increase your capacity twofold (or more) as soon as you charge it encase your phone. That alone is a powerful value proposition.The protection afforded by this case is basic. Don't get me wrong, it will protect your phone in controlled settings like offices. I do not view that as a detriment because this is designed to be a battery extender with collateral benefits of physical protection. The compromise is it does not add bulk or weight to your 5S.One final note: I first though the 'kickstand' was a gimmick to differentiate this from other battery packs. I have actually grown to love it because it allows me to easily view my phone's screen when I am working at my desk. A simple glance shows new events and notifications without craning my neck. It's also great for watching Youtube clips, which I spend too much time on.Bottom line is this is a great battery extender in non harsh environment, and the extra use time it allows makes it a true value.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Impressive performance with basic protection","unixReviewTime":1392681600,"reviewTime":"2014-02-18T00:00:00"}

I was expecting yet another battery pack, but this looks more like a flashlight (and it has that built in!)With the newer crop of batteries the main feature is capacity. This is a modest 3000mAh model that is also not going to set records in fast charging because its output port is 1 Amp versus the 2.1 Amp fast chargers on the Market. However, what I love is this is a flashlight in a battery's body. Or that is how I think of it. The form factor makes it easy to handle as a flashlight at 4 inches long by about .75 inches square. It comes with a convenient carrying pouch that fits in a purse, trouser pocket or dangling from a rear view mirror, so it's handy when you do need a power boost.It is, after all, a battery, so I will address that. It can almost increase the use time on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 by one hundred percent. When you account for loss from charging and storage, though I would say that seventy-five percent is a more valid number. It is more useful with the iPhone 5S, which loves to consume batteries, and the 3000mAh rating of this battery handily augments the 1560mAh rated capacity of that phone.One more feature that I love is the split cable that comes with it - there is a regular USB end for connecting to chargers, with the micro USB end to charge this battery. After it's charged up you can plug the large USB end into the USB port on the battery and choose between a 30-pin connector for old style Apple phones and tablets, or the micro USB for devices that accept those -or use your own cable.Finally, the distinguishing feature that earns this five stars in my book is the integrated protection that prevents over charging or over loading.This may not be the first choice of a power user, but for folks like myself this is a convenient battery pack that is unobtrusive, attractive and functional.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Clever design and handy","unixReviewTime":1395014400,"reviewTime":"2014-03-17T00:00:00"}

I received this as a review sample and it arrived charged one hundred percent.  I still put it on a charger for two hours before testing it out.In most cases this model is simply bigger and higher capacity than its sibling.  At 15000 mAh it has over ten times the capacity of a stock iPhone 4 or 5 series, which are  rated at 1420 mAh. It comes in at just under five times the 3200 mAh capacity of my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and exceeds by about forty percent the capacity of a fourth generation iPad's 11,560 mAh battery. In other words, this has impressive storage and charging capabilities.It has a micro USB port input for charging the unit itself. It's nestled between the two USB out ports and can be a tight fit depending on which cables out you are using. For charging, though, you can use the cable that is provided or your own. The two USB out ports are at different levels. One is rated at 1A and the other is 2.1A and can be used simultaneously. It also ships with an adapter cable with mini and micro USB ends, as well as an Apple 30 pin connector.Note: I have found that this works best when you do not attempt to charge the unit while it's powering other devices. I did use this to power my Galaxy Note 3 and a bluetooth speaker for music and still had sixty-five percent remaining capacity (according to the LED display) twelve hours later. That is impressive to me. In fact I love the large blue lit display that shows the percent remaining power. That feature sets this apart from the myriad of other battery packs I have tested in the past (except the smaller sibling of this model.) For me it's a convenience, but for folks who are emergency responders or who are preparing for an emergency this feature is critical.This also comes with a built-in flashlight that is not particularly powerful, butt makes this perfect for emergencies. It is a bit large and heavy at 4.25 x 2.8 x .8 inches and 8.2 ounces.One final note: if you discharge this pack down to five to ten percent remaining charge it can take up to twelve hours to charge it back up using a standard wall charger. Considering the capacity that is not an unreasonable amount of time. This will probably not charge via a computer USB port - just had to see and after two hours mine did not increase by a percent.Bottom line: compared to its sibling this model gives the most bang for your buck.

Before I go off on a tangent I want to describe this holder and why I love it.This is the first (and thus far only) holder that I have evaluated that will positively hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and keep it exactly where I want it. The two suction cup design is clever because it gives me not only more flexibility than other holds provide, but also a margin of safety. If one cup were to fail for any reason the other is strong enough to keep your precious phone or small tablet from becoming a projectile.The package ships with two holders - one for small tablets up to seven inches, and a smaller one for phones. The smaller one is the one that fits my Note 3. Both have spring loaded grabber arms that firmly hold your phone or tablet. There is a thin, soft film on the inside of the arms, but not on the part that contacts the back of your tablet or phone.There are two types of suction cups employed in the design. The base cup uses a lever to actuate a vacuum and it holds tightly to most surfaces. I tries nit out on my pebble-grained dashboard in my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander and it gripped the surface like it became a part of it. That cup, though, was designed for the windshield, with the second cup designed to hold the flexible gooseneck stable from an attach point on your dashboard. It, too, held that surface firmly and made a big difference in stabilizing and supporting my Note 3.Unfortunately I have no tablets smaller than 10.1 inches, so was unable to test the larger holder. From the rock solid way the assembly held my Note 3, though, I have no doubt it will easily support any seven inch tablet on the market.Of all of the mounts that I have tested this one is a paragon of design, engineering and construction.

I will focus on my own experience for some specific uses as well as general impressions.I test a lot of these battery packs and this one stands out for both looks and performance. Performance is what counts and this pack is right up there with the newest ones on the market. Capacity is is key and the review sample I received had that. While there are a few models that have more capacity, the 17000mAh is up there and is why I love this pack. If you are non technical that number is probably meaningless, so let me put it into context. The following devices come with stock batteries with capacities and use times as follow:* Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.* Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.* Apple iPhone 4S 1440mAh battery with about 6 hours of use time.* Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.* Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.* Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.Using the above numbers this pack will extend, for example, an iPhone 5S' battery capacity by a factor of ten (although with charging and heat losses it's closer to the 700 to 800 percent range.) The net increase in use time goes from 8 to about sixty hours. Doing the math on the other devices cited above yield equally impressive results.I mentioned looks. This pack reminds me of an onyx pen stand that I owned years ago - solid, gleaming black and beautiful. It looks great on a desk, which is where it belongs because at over ten ounces this is not exactly sometime you normally carry in a pocket or purse. It has a convenient night light, which is a feature I do not see myself using since mine is a permanent fixture on my desk. However, this makes a great emergency power supply for folks who camp or hike, so if you do not mind the weight you will have a margin of extra power, plus an emergence light.Bottom line: if you are using power-hungry devices like an iPhone 5S or Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, this battery is worth every penny.

What I love is the case, which is made from thermoplastic polyurethane and does, indeed, absorb shocks. In fact I wish I could find such a case for my Galaxy Note 3 phone.As for the claim that this is 'crystal clear' all I can say is it's so transparent that it does not look like you have a case protecting your phone. The advantage is not just the look, but the fact that this case does not appreciably add to the size of your phone, and the weight difference is nominal.One final thing that I love about this case is the lip that goes around it us slightly curved inward. It's slightly raised above the screen, so your phone may survive a fall on a flat surface.If there is a single improvement that I would like to see it's a slightly enlarged cutout for the charging cable.

There are some excellent features, but there are some things you need to know before you rush out and buy it.The caveats first so you do not waste your time if this does not meet your needs. This charger will put out a maximum of 12.5 Watts at full load, which means that three ports will run at 1 Amp each and port 1 - the red color-coded one - will output a full 2.4 Amps, for a total of 5.4 Amps continuous output. The caveat, which is listed in the instructions, is port 1 can consume the entire output if a device like a late model iPad is connected. This means that the other connected devices will not be charged. Know that going in and you will not be disappointed. I still think that this is a five star product because the limitation is clearly disclosed.This is not just any charger - it has a smart chip that will evenly distribute the charging if you opt to charge four devices at once. It is clearly designed for one primary device like a tablet, and three other lower capacity ones like cameras, overnight charging of most smart phones and similar devices that you would normally take on travel. For those uses this is very convenient.I tested mine with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in one of the 1 Amp ports, a Samsung Tab 3 10.1 in the high capacity port and two bluetooth speakers in the remaining ports. The Galaxy was at 70% and the Tab 3 was at 50% charge. I have no idea what the two speakers were at because they did not have accurate indicators, but I am guessing around fifty percent each. The whole collection took about eight hours to fully charge simultaneously.While this is designed as a travel charger with folding prongs that are polarity neutral so you can plug in right-side up or upside down, I use it for a home charger most of the time. In fact, aside from the review sample I own an additional one because of how handy they are in my household that is brimming with speakers, phones and other devices that are always being in some state of charging.

Second, it fast charged both my Galaxy Note 3 phone and my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 simultaneously.

The balance between minimalism and protection are still incorporated into the design, but the back is frosted and the color scheme is blue. To extend my trite opening, this 2014 model is a marriage of good design and aesthetics.I was provided with a review sample by the manufacturer, in part I am sure, because of how much I loved the older model. Since most folks are probably not familiar with the older design that this one shares I'll rehash the key points:PROTECTION: The rigid case is strong enough to protect against hard surfaces and objects, but is also pliable and capable of absorbing (or at least mitigating) shocks from short distance drops. In addition the top part of the face is raised above the phone's screen.  If you drop your phone on a flat, hard surface the raised lip of the case will provide some protection for your screen. Of course,  all bets are off if you drop it on an uneven surface like gravel or rocks. This is a case that is more at home indoors than one whose owner participates nin rigorous activities.CONSTRUCTION: Pliable, shock absorbing material surrounding your phone, with a hard (and still slightly cushioned) back.FUNCTION: Everything fits as though this was an integral part of the phone itself. This is especially true of the camera and flash. If you previously owned an iPhone 4 you will especially appreciate the improved camera performance of the 5 or 5S in this case. Plus you can use your screen up to the very edge, something other cases do not allow.Here is what this one has that trumps the older model: aesthetics. The color is certainly not boring. It's vivid in fact. And the frosted back still allows the Apple logo to show, but the frosting adds texture and depth.The bottom line, though, is this case provides more protection than you would guess at a glance, and is more than just a pretty face at the altar.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Something old, something new ...","unixReviewTime":1397606400,"reviewTime":"2014-04-16T00:00:00"}

I did not quite know what it was, but a quick run through the brief - but succinct - instructions revealed a low capacity, cleverly designed battery pack.'Low capacity' is a relative term. A year ago a 2600mAh battery back was considered substantial. There are packs on the market now that provide ten times the capacity, but at a healthy price as well. This one, at the ten bucks it's going for at the time of this review, is almost an impulse buy. Before I get into my test results and some of the other features, let me put the 2600mAh into perspective.  First I use a coefficient of .9 for batteries to get a more realistic capacity. This accounts for the reduction from heat, charging and other factor. So I am going to consider this battery to have an effective capacity of 2340mAh.  Even using the smaller capacity this battery is:- 170 percent of the capacity of an iPhone 4S or 5S (those batteries are 1,440mAh)- Approximately 70 percent of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3's 3300mAh battery- 25 percent of a fourth generation iPad's 11,560mAh batteryIn other words it is perfect for all but the true power user, and is a great source of power for when you are off the grid or do not have convenient access to electrical outlets.It fully charged no Note 3 from 80% to 100% in about an hour, so it's pretty fast. In fact, it is one of the fastest chargers of any capacity that I have tested, and ironically it's only rated at 1 Amp output.The reason that I said that it's clever is the battery can be directly plugged into a PC's USB port or any USB charger, and it has micro USB and Apple Lightning connectors to charge devices that are compatible with those. I do need to note that it takes a long time to charge this battery up from PC USB ports. My ThinkPad T61 took four hours to bring the battery from 2 LEDs (25 to 50 percent) to 100 percent. From my Samsung OEM wall charger it took less than half that time.Overall, this is a convenient way to have spare power on hand for those days when you are on your phone or tablet a lot and have no access to power or a charger.

Like her I received mine as a review sample, and like her I am impressed. For once someone has come out with an organizer that takes into account that the world is full of electronic devices that need to be (1) properly stored, and (2) charged.This makes no attempt to provide the charging electronics - that is up to you. What it does is provide a clever way of organizing and routing cables to tablets and phones that you store with it. This is perfect for households what have two or more tablets and as many phones. In my household I am the exclusive user with a phone and tablet, so I use the other parts of the organizer for stationary and some documents.Aesthetically this looks just like an old fashioned desk accessory. It fits my personal decor, but I would have loved one in brown. As for it being leather I cannot say for sure. It does not have the chemical odor of faux leather, so I am inclined to believe that it is genuine,One use I have put the bottom compartment to is as a hiding place for valuables. Since I only have two charging cables snaked into it, there is ample space for a few twenties, a watch and some other valuables.If you want an old school organizer that will accommodate an array of charging cables in an organized manner, this is it. Like Henry ford said of the Model T: \"You can have any color as long as it's black.\" That is a limitation that I can live with.","overall":5.0,"summary":"No electronics, but very handy","unixReviewTime":1402444800,"reviewTime":"2014-06-11T00:00:00"}

I was surprised by the size, which is smaller than the earlier generations of batteries. This one also had a nice display that not only showed the percent of charge, but also if it was being charged or charging another device. To me that is a big plus over batteries that have no display or use four small LEDs to indicate the approximate percent of charge remaining. This one is exact to one percent.What impressed me is the capacity. Last year a battery rated at 5600mAh was like a brick compared to this one. Before I go on, let me explain rated capacity. There are a number of factors that make it misleading in much the same manner that US EPA ratings for MPG are pie-in-the-sky. Factors such as heat, wear on the battery from repeated charging and even loss from poor quality cables and connectors reduce the rating. Out of the box I multiply the rated capacity by .9, and in the case of this one you can realistically expect about 5040mAh. As time goes on the wear on this battery will reduce the figure to about 3920, but that is probably twelve to eighteen months of hard use.Assuming that this is realistically rated at 5040mAh here is what you can expect from a few common devices:  For an iPhone 5S with an internal battery rated at 1560mAh you can expect to more than triple your use time. For my Samsung Tab 3 10.1, which comes with a stock 6800mAh battery I can still get well over an additional seventy percent more use time. You can do the math on your own device and see how well this will or will not fit your needs.Another feature that impressed me is the charging port will detect the rate your device can be charged and adjust the output accordingly. The range is between 1.0 and 2.1 Amps.A convenience is the built-in flashlight. It's actually handy because of the compact size of this battery. But that it icing on the cake. The unit itself does a great job quickly charging my devices, and with the integrated circuitry to detect charging rates and guard against over charging I feel safe with it charging my Note 3 and tablet, both of which were on the expensive side.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Clever design with some useful features","unixReviewTime":1398902400,"reviewTime":"2014-05-01T00:00:00"}

A great example is Miles Davis'Kind Of Blue, which I use to test all of my speakers and phones.That particular album exercises the high, mid and low frequency response and it sounded great on this speaker. However, the bassist (Paul chambers) is on a double bass, which is nothing like the electric bass used on most modern songs. For Kind of Blue this speaker sounded like it was made for that album, and I also tried it on some Oscar Peterson albums because Ray Brown's bass is heavier and has a grwl to it. Still perfect. When I switched to a Led Zepplin album John Paul Jones' bass sounded a bit thin. I am not surprised because the frequency range is 80Hz to 20KHz. For deep, thumping bass you need the lower end to be in the 20Hz range. Still, for my favorite music this is THE speaker.Although this is perfect as a personal speaker on a night stand or desk top, it puts out some volume. When I tested it for distance at thirty feet the music streamed perfectly from my Note 3 phone, and the volume from that distance was surprisingly loud when I cranked both the phone's volume and the speaker's.Pairing and connecting is a snap: as soon as you turn it on you can scan for it on your phone or tablet and it immediately shows up. None of that pressing a multifunction button for a precise number of seconds and praying or chanting. I love that feature and it's one of the many reasons why I give it five stars (the sound quality being the other reasons.)In addition to function, ease of use and sound, it looks good. Of course that is just the icing when compared to the other factors. But it's still a plus, as is the construction, which is solid.The only thing that puzzled me is mine arrived without any documentation. I did not need any because I have tested dozens of these things, but someone new would be a bit bewildered. I am not sure if it actually does not ship with instructions, or mine was just missing from the package.Bottom line: if you are a jazz aficionado a la Prestige's golden years this speaker merits serious consideration. If bass and drum centric music is your thing, you may be disappointed. For what it is, though, it is an easy five stars the way I rate.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Excellent for acoustic jazz","unixReviewTime":1401753600,"reviewTime":"2014-06-03T00:00:00"}

In fact, I was amazed by the ease and convenience of not being tethered to a cable. Of course, the charging unit is, but since you are not constantly inserting and removing a charging cable directly into your phone it saves wear and tear. The port on my Note 3 is getting worn from that, and this is a blessing.However, it's not perfect. The review sample that I received came with scant instructions. I found that the NFC pad that goes over my Note 3's battery has to align perfectly with the connectors in the phone itself. They do not snap in as I had assumed, but do need to make contact. They are held in place by your phone's battery cover. If they are not aligned the charging platform will detect it, but the phone will not give any indication of charging. After I figured this out the phone charged up exactly per the product description.Another issue I have is the NFC pad that goes inside your phone actually increases the thickness after you snap the back cover on. It's probably less than a millimeter, but it prevented me from using my favorite case (aFliptroniks Chocolate Panther Leather Wallet Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I tried a few other cases that I had accumulated with the same results. I finally tried aBear Motion Genuine Lambskin Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which fit the phone like a glove.

I normally dislike this style of in-ear headset, but this one is so light that wearing it was almost a pleasure.What I love, though, is the clarity at both ends of a phone conversation. I could almost hear a pin drop on my end (an exaggeration, but I wanted to emphasize just how clearly I could hear folks on the other end.) On outgoing calls the folks whom I called thought I was on a landline, and one of those calls was outside in a breeze. To me that is remarkable.The directions claimed that you could see battery levels if you are using this with an iPhone. Unfortunately the person who normally assists me with Apple devices was not available so I could not test that claim. However, this paired and connected quickly and easily to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.One other claim that I did test is echo reduction. There is a number on my Verizon plan that echoes whenever I call it and talk to the person at the other end. Using this headset the echo was diminished to the point where it was gone. Bravo for that.A final reason why I love this is the clever charging dock. For one thing there is an attachment that is designed to attach it to an air vent in my car. To be honest I only tested that because my car is equipped with a hands free system that means I do not need this headset while driving. The clever part, though, is the headset goes into sleep mode while it's docked, but just lifting it when an incoming call comes will activate it.I could go on and on, but I would wind up repeating the product specs and some of the excellent reviews that others have posted. Instead I will say that although I normally donate or give away review samples after I've tested them, this one is a keeper.

This one is simpler to use by a long shot. Of course, it is a little less protective than the other one, but this will protect any iPhone 5/5S against water, dust and sand. It is not intended for diving, so if you are seeking that kind of case, this is not it.My other case required an advanced degree in engineering to install. Well, it seemed that way to me. This one is as simple as unbuckling some snaps, removing the protective film from both sides of the screen and inserting your phone. Once you button it up, you are good to go.One word of caution - the instructions wisely advise that you test this empty before entrusting your phone to it. I agree. My submerge test in my sink proved to me that this would keep my phone bone dry. Also, the instructions are crystal clear and you do need to carefully read them before jumping into using this case.You can access all features and functions on your phone, including taking photos. The screen protector keeps out water, but allows you to interact with your phone with fingers as you normally would without any interference.This was shipped in a hard plastic case with foam inside and out to prevent damage while in transit. I think that is a nice touch because it maintains the integrity of the case during shipping and handling - and that is essential to it properly doing its job.If you work in hostile environments that are wet, smokey, or dusty this is the perfect protection for your iPhone.

Honestly I have reviewed so many chargers that I have become somewhat jaded, but this one stands out for a few reasons.First, two of the three ports are among the fastest charging ones I have ever tested, and that is saying a lot because I put this to the test. I charged an iPad (second generation), Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and a Galaxy Note 3 simultaneously. The iPad and Tab 3 were plugged into the 2.1 and 2.0 Amp ports respectively, and the Note 3 into the 1.0 Amp port. Although the Notre 3 chugged along fairly slowly, the two tablets charged quickly. Of course the Note 3 was plugged into the slowest port on this charger, so the fact that it was slow is not a detriment. In fact, that was the expected result.Second, this charger has an array of protective features that lesser ones lack. It detects and protects against over heating and over voltage, and will also prevent overcharging. In addition there is short circuit protection. Considering the total cost to replace the devices I tested, this feature alone is worth the premium price of this charger.Although this is capable of safely providing a full 5.1 Amps simultaneously, be aware that if you have an older vehicle that cannot provide that level of current this charger cannot perform miracles. It worked flawlessly in my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander.If you need high speed charging of expensive devices this charger is an investment in ensuring their safe charging.

The face that houses the ports is slightly over an inch square, and the overall unit (not counting the spring loaded contact) is 2.25 inches long, of which a little less than an inch protrudes from your lighter socket. This makes it ideal for cramped spaces.What is interesting is this charger is clearly designed for tablets and fast charging phones. While there are no 1.0 Amp ports the internal protective circuitry prevents the higher capacity ports from overcharging phones or devices that normally use lower capacity charging current.This charger simultaneously fast charged an iPad 2 and Samsung Tab 3 10.1 in my test. Both devices were at approximately seventy percent when I started the test and both were fully charged in less than an hour in an operational vehicle. That is faster than any other charger that I own. Plus the charger itself remained relatively cool. Some I have tested get pretty hot during such tests.A feature that I love is this phone glows when it's properly inserted into a lighter socket. Newer chargers use LEDs to do that, and one that I own is so bright at night that it's distracting. This one isn't - it's softer and actually functions as a night light of sorts in my vehicle's console.  What I do not like, though, is the ports are not clearly marked. The only way to tell the 2.4 Amp port from the 2.0 one is to make sure that you insert this into your socket with the logo facing up. I would have loved tiny pinpoint LEDs of different colors next to each port to tell which is which.Port identification notwithstanding, this charger outperformed most chargers that I have tested and was the [electrical] equal of the higher end ones.

In inches that works out to be 1.65 to 2.79 inches.In actual fact, that dimension should have read width instead of length because my long Samsung Galaxy Note 3 battery (which is in excess of three inches long) not only fit, but charged perfectly. I also tested this on an HTC Driod Incredible and it worked perfectly on that phone's battery as well. There is a spring-loaded arm that opens to accept batteries with widths within the range I cited above, and they hold the battery firmly in place during the charging cycle.What I love is the ability to charge a spare battery while simultaneously charging a phone with a battery installed. That feature makes this perfect as a travel charger (the folding prongs add to the function for that use. It is also ideal as an office charger for folks who frequently spend most of their work day in the field.Do heed the two prominent notices in the specs (1) it is ONLY for phone batteries, and (2) it will only work with batteries that have contact points on the end (not the front of back). Indeed, the contacts on your battery (the metal strips that mate with your phone) cannot be closer than 3/8 inch from the edge of the battery, nor more than 5/8 inch away. If they fall outside of that range then this charger will not work for you.For batteries that do fit this charger will automatically detect the type and capacity and charge it properly.

For iPhones or phones of similar size this holder does work well.My test with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 indicates that not only is this a tight fit, but getting the phone into the jaws of the clamp was an exercise in frustration. Like Comdet mentioned, when I had the clamps at the last adjustment stop, opening the spring loaded jaw further to fit the Note 3 would disengage the jaw from the adjustment stop. If you remember what flypaper is, this cycle of events is akin to unsticking that stuff. The more you tried, the more frustrating it is.On the other hand, an iPhone 5S fit the clamp as though they were designed for each other and this product was transformed from a mechanical demon to an absolute joy to use. Among the reasons why it was a joy with the smaller phones are the protective strips on the sides of the clamp (the blue areas in the photos) that ensure your phone will not be marred or scratched. Another reason why I love this for the smaller phones is the suction cup holds strongly, even on the pebble-grained dashboard in my vehicle. And finally, the ability to swivel the phone to just about any conceivable angle adds a lot of convenience.  Some holders that I have tested were limited in viewing angle, so this one is a step ahead of that group.Bottom line: if you own a phone the size of a Note II or Note 3, look elsewhere because while this one will work, it's too much trouble in my opinion.

Charme's helpful April 17, 2014 review the physical characteristics of this battery pack are well covered. Instead of my rehashing them I will discuss why I love the review sample I received from the manufacturer and why I awarded it five stars.Foremost, this pack offers added capacity that is ideal for power phone users as well as tablets. For most business users (or even folks who are heavy gamers) you can easily double your use time on most devices, and for phones extend it by a factor of three or better on many models. What I love is the thin form factor that appears to be designed for we tablet users. More about that later.I will give a few examples of what the 8000mAh capacity means for some common devices. First, I always use a coefficient to normalize the rated capacity of these packs. That is to account for loss from heat, the charging process itself, and wear on the battery pack from repeated charging. I multiply the rated capacity of brand new batteries by .9 to account for the losses, so this one is actually in the 7200mAh range. That's still a lot of capacity. For example, my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 comes with a stock 6800mAh battery, which provides approximately 7 hours use time. The added capacity of this battery will add another 7.5 to 8 hours of use time.If you own an iPhone 5S, which consumes battery with wild abandon this pack will extend the use time over our and a half times. When you consider that the 5S' 1560mAh battery provides approximately 8 hours use time, this pack will add around thirty-six additional hours to that.Using the same math on a few other common devices this pack will easily double the use time on an iPad 2, and triple it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.Other features that I love are the flat cable because it does not tangle and is easy to store, and the fiber pouch that makes storing this pack easy (and attractive.) The final thing I love is the price, which is in the thirty buck range at the time of this review. While the capacity of these packs are increasing (this would have been very high capacity last year, but is not a mid range pack), the prices are falling. This one will satisfy most power users, although there will be folks who need some of the ultra high capacity packs. However, for most of us, this is more than sufficient and the price is right.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Excellent mid-range battery pack","unixReviewTime":1397779200,"reviewTime":"2014-04-18T00:00:00"}

I'll refrain from regurgitating the product specs and simply explain my observations and the reasons why think this is a five star charger.When I received a review sample of this battery pack I charged it via a wall charger, then put it through some tests. First was a test the simultaneous charging capability since it has two output ports. I did this by connecting my Galaxy Note 3 phone and Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Both were in the ninety percent charged range and both were at one hundred percent in about thirty minutes.Since the key feature is the ability to recharge the internal 5000mAh battery using solar energy I tested that next. After I discharged the battery to about fifty percent (indicated by two remaining lit LEDs) I tested that capability. Even on a slightly overcast day it took about ten hours to charge it up the remaining fifty percent. Not bad to be honest.There is a charging port that allows you to more quickly charge this from a wall or car charger. That process can take five to seven hours,and I recommend doing just that if you are preparing for camping or otherwise going off the grid.Some of the features that impress me about this battery is it's designed to be water resistant and shock proof. I also like the fact that it has status lights that show at a glance the capacity (in twenty-five percent increments).I will not say that it's indestructible, but it's definitely sturdy and will withstand a lot of abuse in a harsh environment.

If you are in a household or office with a few tablets and high-end phones this may not be as ideal. That is not an issue for me because the price to performance ratio still makes it a value, but I want to set expectations.Since this charger will operate on AC voltages ranging from 100 to 240 at 50 or 60 cycles you can use it internationally. Just replace the two prong figure-eight style cable with one that matches the outlets where you are visiting and it works.The specific limitation is this charger has a total of five amps output. That is clearly stated in the specs on this page, but is easy to overlook. What that means is the internal circuit is intelligent enough to level current as you plug more devices into it. for example, if you add up the ratings on each port you will see that they total 7.5 Amps. If you plug tablets drawing 2.1 Amps into ports 1 and 3 and a phone drawing one Amp into port 4 the two tablets will get only 2 Amps each. If you were to fill all of the ports, each device will only receive a Amp at five volts regardless of how the port is marked. This is not a problem. In fact, it's a safety feature because the device has the built in logic to ensure that it will not over charge a device.For someone like me who has a tablet and a high end phone this has value because I can charge both simultaneously at full speed and still manage to charge a headset. If I plug more devices into it, my phone and tablet will still charge at a respectable rate, while the other devices will also charge. For overnight charging this is an excellent solution.I am giving this five solid stars because the specs are clearly state the maximum output and this has protections against over heating and over charging.

This is especially true of the camera and flash. If you previously owned an iPhone 4 you will especially appreciate the improved camera performance of the 5 or 5S in this case.

At first I was a bit put off by the short cable length, but have come to see it as a major plus. One reason is the short cord is strong and because it's flat it's also tangle-free. But the main reason is the longer the cord, the easier it is to snap unless it's super thick, which defeats the main feature: portability.The model that I received is strictly for folks who have devices that use a micro USB input. The brand also has Apple 30-pin and Lightning models, but this one is for Android phones. It's also mainly for charging. I would not want to attempt data transfer for a few reasons. First, my Samsung phone is particular about which cables it transfers over, and second, it's too short for much more than emergency use. But that is another reason why I gave it five stars: it fits on my keychain and is always available.Bottom line: if you are looking for a charging cable that you will be using all the time, this is probably not it.

However, I am not sure mounting anything with an interactive display on a steering wheel is a good idea from a safety perspective. Finally, while the rubber strap firmly holds the mount in place (except for some flopping around when turning the steering wheel), the diameter at 1.5 inches before it is stretched is a bit large.The idea behind this is creative, but in practice this mount needs to be refactored to meet the needs of a different market segment. For example, if the strap was adjustable (or a quick release) this would be a perfect mount for microphone stands. I am betting that there are a lot more musicians who have valid needs to mount their phone on a mic stand than there are drivers who want to mount one to their steering wheel.

I certainly concur with most of her points, but some of my experiences and observations are different.The sound quality is almost at the same level as an in-ear monitor, which is truly impressive.While you can only control this speaker from an external source (either the included remote or an iPhone or Android smartphone app), you are not fumbling with multifunction buttons that are both small and in some cases confusing. For me this feature is right up there with sound quality. If you lose the remote (or it gets destroyed by a pet), you can still control the speaker via your phone. Of course at this time there are only apps for IOS and Android, so if you are using a Windows-based phone you are going to be out of luck. As for finding the app, it's ironic that it is not available in Amazon's app store at the time of this review, but I found it by searching the Google Play Store using yantouch as the keyword. The app name is BedTimeSocial. More about that below.One feature that I immediately loved is how easy it is to connect this via bluetooth. No weird button sequences to navigate: press the bluetooth button on the remote, scan for new devices with your phone, tablet or PC, pair and connect.When I received my review sample I was a little perplexed by the unit. The split cable with a micro USB and a 3.5mm connector threw me, but I discovered that one was for powering the speaker and the other was to plug in a hardwired sound source, like a non-bluetooth MP3 player or sound out from your PC. Here is the catch: you cannot power your speaker from the same source that provides the sound signal. In other words, you cannot connect both ends to a PC - out for sound and the other for power. The signal quality doing that is terrible (I had to try.) But that is clearly cited in the instructions, so it's a non issue for me. This speaker works with any USB cable with a micro USB end and a separate 3.5mm cable, so the split cable that ships with it is a convenience, not a requirement. You can also use any USB wall charger that is rated at 1.0 Amps (it will not work with anything below that, which includes a lot of PC USB ports.)The remote is a major convenience. There is even a slot for it in the speaker itself. Since downloading the Android app, though, I prefer using my phone to control it since that is where I am streaming music from anyway. I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android 4.3 and the app provides me with all of the features on the remote as well as using the speaker as an alarm clock.Overall I am totally pleased with this speaker based on the sound quality alone. When I factor in the convenience of being able to control it from my phone I feel it raises the bar for all higher end bluetooth speakers.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Better than anticipated","unixReviewTime":1398556800,"reviewTime":"2014-04-27T00:00:00"}

It also held it sufficiently steady and firmly that I have no concerns about it dropping the phone when cycling over smooth, paved roadways. For rougher riding I am not sure I would entrust my phone to the clamp, but that is just me being overly cautious (and unwilling to put my phone to that sort of test.)The clamp that attaches this mount to a handlebar or steering post has multiple stops, so it will fit most bikes. The quick release design isn't as easy as I would have liked. I hope that the next version of this mount employs an easier release along the lines of this unrelated product:Pearl ADP20 Adapter. Still, the clamp is definitely not going to slip off the handlebar so I am wishing more than complaining.  And I love the split rubber grommet that protects the finish of the handlebar. That is a nice touch.In addition to this working as intended, it also worked perfectly attached to a microphone stand and to my drum kit's hi-hat stand. I use my phone to run a metronome app as well as a few other music related applications and this clamp is absolutely perfect for stage, studio or practice room. I am sure there are even more uses that I have not thought of.Bottom line: for what this is designed to do it's easily a five star product (ignore my nitpicking above).

However, the more I used it (and I thoroughly test anything before posting a review) the more I was impressed. It seemed faster than most other chargers that I have used with the same basic 2.1 and 1.0 amp port ratings. I tested two Apple devices (iPad 2 and iPhone 5S) and two Androids (Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Samsung Tab 3 10.1). I purposely charged the phones in the 2.1 amp ports and the tablets in the 1.0 amp ones and even at 70% remaining capacity for the tablets when I plugged them in none took over three hours to charge up to 100%.These do not overheat either. The specs do not say so, but I am betting that crammed into the approximately two square inch form factor are over charging and over heating protections. And it's the form factor that truly impressed me. This may not have a gang of ports or a lot of bells and whistles some of the newer chargers have, but it is tiny. Combine that with the charging times that I observed and it is a value for those who spend most of their time living out of suit cases. Those folks tend to travel light and most need no more than the two ports this charger provides. I know because I spent a lot of my career traveling and less is more when you do that.Do note that while this works with the modern Samsung tablets like my Tab 3 10.1, it will not work with older Galaxy Tab models.

It may not easily fit in a pants pocket or small purse, but does in a backpack and it provides a lot of spare power when you are away from the grid or access to outlets is problematic.Last year it would have been one of the higher capacity batteries on the market, but this year it is in the mid range. For me and probably ninety percent of other users this is not an issue because 10400mAh is a lot of spare capacity. Before proceeding I want to let you know that I always multiply new battery packs by .9 to get a more realistic capacity. That's because there are some losses in efficiency from heat, the transfer process, condition of your charging cable and myriad other factors. Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery. What this means in real life is if you are using an Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh this will provide an additional six hundred percent of use time.  For an iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery it will slightly more than double your use time.I did some quick tests with the aforementioned Apple devices, plus my Galaxy Note 3 and Tab 3 10.1, and this battery pack simultaneously charged up the pair of Apples, then did the same for the pair of Samsungs - and did so as quickly as when I was using OEM chargers plugged into the wall. That is impressive because there is usually some latency when charging from a battery, but I did not notice any appreciable difference.One of the feature that I love is the real LED display that shows exactly how much capacity is remaining down to the one percent. This is a vast improvement over the old style LEDs that would show increments of twenty or twenty-five percent (depending on brand and model). This has a built in flashlight too, so for camping it is a useful feature. A better set of features is the integrated circuit that prevents over charging, loading and discharging, and protects against short circuits. That gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling more than a flashlight.One final thing that impressed me is the price, which at the time of this review is around thirty bucks. A year ago battery packs with the same rated capacity were going for over three times as much, so as the technology improves the price seems to keep dropping. This model is not only priced to reflect that, but has features like the LED display that was lacking on the earlier generation of these batteries. I give this one an easy five stars for value, features and performance.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Some nice features","unixReviewTime":1400889600,"reviewTime":"2014-05-24T00:00:00"}

This speaker is about 2.5 inches in diameter and two inches tall, yet it puts put a full, rich sound with decent low end, and a nicely balanced mid and high range. Music, especially the circa 1950s jazz to which I listen, sounds fantastic.Of course, sound is the most important feature, but there are others that set this speaker apart. Foremost (to me) is the way this beacons its presence to any bluetooth device as soon as you turn it on. Earlier speakers, including models from EasyAcc, required you to jump through hoops to pair and connect. As soon as I turned this one on I scanned from my phone and it immediately showed up. A touch of my finger paired and connected it. Yet another thing I love is the buttons are conveniently placed and the is no multifunction button that was one of the trickiest and most confusing controls on an earlier generation of speakers from just about every manufacturer.This is also feature rich with a radio, speaker, hand's free connection to your phone and even an SD card slot. The radio is functional, but a bit clumsy since it will scan and remember stations, but if you are the type to station hop among favorites you will be frustrated. But the key point is that it does contain a radio and it gets surprisingly good reception (I tested it on a local station that is normally marginal and the signal locked and was clear.)You get about four hours of play time from a two hour charge, which is sufficient for me. This is designed to be a personal speaker, so mine will spend most of its life on a desk teetered to a charging cable anyway.Bottom line: this is a great speaker at an impulse-buy price.

That alone is very useful to me because I am using this in my home music studio and RFI and EMI are two problem sources for any musician who has a home studio. Those two are also problems for folks who own high end home electronics and computing gear.Second, the design prevents you from overloading circuits. The manufacturer has cleverly designed this to take up two wall outlets by adding a plastic, non-conducting plug for the ground receptacle in bottom outlet. This ensures that only this unit will be powered by that circuit. Since I have a tendency to overload outlets this feature keeps me from being my own enemy.I love the way that this unit integrates two USB charging ports and three AC outlets into a single unit.

A little research turned up the fact that this battery has an NFC antenna built into it that works with the NFC circuit and software in my phone. I tested this out with an NFC-enabled speaker and the new battery worked like the OEM one.The next test was to see if it would fully charge. It did. Other batteries that I have tested with my Note 3 would charge to 99%, then hover there forever. I discharged the battery down to 90% two additional times and recharged it to make sure this battery did not have memory effect issues.

When it first arrived I tried it out with a few platforms and tested the claimed specifications. I am satisified that they are accurate.This hub works with Windows 98 (I have an old Sony running it and this hub plugged in and worked with it), and above. I know it works with Win XP, Vista and 7 because I also tested the hub on those platforms. I do not have access to a Windows 8 system so am taking the manufacturer's word that it works on that too. If your experience is different please leave a comment.If you have a computer and peripherals that are USB 3.0 compliant this hub will boost your transfer speeds significantly. However, if you wanted to attach an external 3.0 hard drive to your laptop this hub will allow it to operate to it's full potential - which is lightning fast.Note that this is not intended to be used as a charger. However I did test it and it charged my two phones while I was doing other tasks. It also kept my bluetooth speaker powered and charged. Perhaps the specs mean it is not intended to be a standalone charger.My favorite feature and the reason I awarded this hub five stars is the integrated electrical safeguards that protect against over voltage, over current, leakage and short circuits. This may not be a big deal for cheap peripherals like mice, but for an expensive hard drive or my Galaxy Note 3 it's a welcome feature.One final feature that makes this a five star hub in my opinion is the fact that this will simultaneously support maximum data transfer of up to four high speed devices (three of which can be USB 3.0) plugged into it. Of course the host system needs to be USB 3.0 too, but the hub will sling data as fast as the host can accept it. Not all hubs will operate in this mode, and I suspect that the external power supply has something to do with that level of performance.The only thing that I do NOT like is the wall wart type power supply that is approximately 3x2x2 inches. It can (and does) block adjacent plugs in my surge protector. However, I can live that that considering the functionality I get from this hub.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Major convenience","unixReviewTime":1403568000,"reviewTime":"2014-06-24T00:00:00"}

They were sufficiently charged out of the box to test, but I recommend a full charge before using them. I was initially skeptical about these, but quickly came to like them a lot. The only reason why I didn't 'love' them is I have some very expensive in ear monitors and these are not in their league. However, for the price range and for what they do I think that they are five star all the way, and here are my reasons.First, these will pair and connect as soon as you turn them on and scan for them from your phone or tablet. I love the sliding on/off switch and the fact that individual buttons are provided for each function. I hate it when I am using speakers and phones that combine volume and skip functions into a single button because I invariably wind up skipping a song when I wanted to turn the volume up.Second, the sound quality is excellent. Not especially loud, mind you, so if you like your music blaring in your ears these phones are not for you. Even when I adjusted the volume on my phone, which automatically lowers it when I plug in phones, these were not particularly loud. However, they reproduce the full sonic spectrum of high, mid and low frequencies with a lot of clarity.Third, they are comfortable. I am not fond of in-ear phones to begin with, but these are easy to wear for hours. They come with extra tips as well. I especially love the design where the main body sits on your neck while the phones are in-ear tethered by a very light cable. I initially thought the cable would be the weak point, but it's strong.One thing to note: the cover for the charging port opens on both ends. The top end houses the actual charging port and the bottom portion houses some mystery connector that is not covered in the docs. I am mentioning that because when I first went to charge this unit I saw the strange connector and was baffled until I fully removed the cover.A few final notes: I am not going to regurgitate the product description on this page, but will verify that you can, in fact, connect two phones to this simultaneously, and the incoming and outgoing calls are clear on both ends based on my very brief tests. To me this is one of the best sets of casual listening phones I have tested, and especially in its price range.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Surprisingly good sound and cofortable","unixReviewTime":1404604800,"reviewTime":"2014-07-06T00:00:00"}

Of course this is highly subjective and your experience may be the opposite.What is beyond dispute, though, is the smooth way this stylus glides across a screen. I use it with my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and it works beautifully. I have the feel I want, and the precision positioning that this stylus allows. I gave one to a friend who owns an iPad 2 and she was as happy with it as I am, so my opinion about feel may be personal judgement, but the operational aspects are not.I tried it on my Galaxy Note 3 phone and it worked as a generic stylus, but is not a substitute for the S-Pen that phone was designed for. Probably the most impressive test was with an HTC Droid Incredible, which has a relatively small screen. This stylus was so precise that I was able to quickly perform any function with a lot more precision than with my finger.This comes with extra tips and even a lanyard that fits the small loop in the top of the stylus. I prefer using the integrated pocket clip and have not used the lanyards, but they look sturdy and some folks will find them to be handy.Bottom line: for me this is the perfect stylus based on form factor and the easy way it glides across the screens of devices with which I have tested it.

I'll start with those: the biggest plus to this one is each port has its own circuit.If you've carefully shopped you know that every other charging hub on the market has ports designated for Apple and Android. Most of the time they are interchangeable. On this hub each port will adapt to what you plug into it. That is the most important distinction.Each connector has a sensing circuit that will detect the charging rate of your devices, then prevent them from over charging. If one port were to burn out the remaining ones will continue to work (not that I am expecting any port to burn out on mine, but I do live in a lightning prone area.)This hub also has some features that I love. On the top of my list is the cord, which is almost five feet long. That gives me the freedom to place the hub where I want it, instead of having a short cord act as a leash. Also this hub will work on AC current ranging from 100 to 240V, so it's ready for international use out of the box. You will still have to provide a plug adapter though.I tested mine with a variety of devices, including my power hungry Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and it charged it as quickly as the OEM charger that came with it. This test was conducted with all four ports populated with Samsung, HTC and Apple devices and I selected the ports randomly.Bottom line: if you are seeking a quality multi-port charging hub and do not want to concern yourself with mundane decisions like which port does a particular device get plugged into, this is the one. I am sure that other companies will copy this design, but for now this is the only one I have found that is device independent for each port and charges at full speed on each.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Intelligently designed and stands out from many others","unixReviewTime":1401667200,"reviewTime":"2014-06-02T00:00:00"}

What I mean is many multi-port chargers on the market will claim, say, 2 amps for some ports and 1 amps for others, but when you added the rated capacities of each port the total falls short of the total capacity of the charger. This charger, however, claims two amps for the first two ports and one amp each for the other two, equaling 6 amps total output. That matches the capacity or the charger claimed in the specs, which is refreshing. Better, if you are not charging four devices at once the two top ports will actually go to 2.1 amps, for even faster charges.I tested this with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone, Samsung Tab 3 10.1 tablet, iPad 2 and iPhone 5S. This charger handled all of them without overheating and the devices all completely charged in less than two hours. Of course not all finished at the same time and each had a different remaining battery capacity, but the key point is this charger handled them without problems or heating up.Another feature is this accepts AC input voltages from 100 to 240 volts, and works on either 50 or 60 cycle power. So for international travel all you need do is add a wall adapter to convert the two prong form factor to whatever is used in your locale. The two prong plug is polarity neutral so you can plug them in upside down and they will work.Bottom line: this is a great way to charge four devices simultaneously.

First, there is a very thin sheet of protective plastic on the base and the backrest. It MUST be removed, otherwise this will not function properly. It took some fingernail probing for an edge before I was able to lift and peel the sheets off. Once I did I installed the included clear plastic holder with the lip on the backrest.

I then retested them by replacing the HTC with a Samsung Tab 3 10.1 in the 1 Amp port and the charger still worked perfectly. My final test was in that configuration, driving the thirty miles to Daytona Beach with my Note 3 streaming music and the GPS active. Not only did this charger keep up, it fully charged it from 80% to 100.

The speaker's frequency response across the high, low and mid ranges did an excellent job of playing my favorite test album (Miles Davis'Kind Of Blue) and I could hear every nuance.

Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery.Even at the readjusted capacity you can expect some significant increases in use time. An Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh battery will get an additional six hundred percent of use time attached to this. An iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery will get slightly more than double its normal use time.

At close to eight feet it stretches from my living room wall to an end table that is a good six feet from the nearest outlet. I am not wild about the transformer part of the power assembly, but on the other hand it keeps the hub itself small.If you do not care about the long power cord feature there are a few more that may be meaningful to you.

Where I live this is a big plus because we have electrical issues from storms and the grid itself.Another feature that I like is on two of the ports that are designated as super chargers the is an extra level of protection and intelligence. Each of these ports are for high output devices that draw up to 2.1 Amps of current when being charged. These ports have auto detect circuits that sense the device being charged and adjust accordingly. This prevents overcharging, and also resolves compatibility issues that some devices have.

Given the glowing reviews from folks whom I trust I am going to chalk mine up to a fluke. However, even though I am willing to give benefit of the doubt there are a few issues I have with it anyway.Here are the design errors that I have found and I do not attribute these to a lapse in manufacturing. First, the documentation is truly confusing. I did not need the instructions since I have used literally dozens of bluetooth devices, but a first time user is going to be frustrated. One example is the instruction that tells you to turn on the pairing button. There is no pairing button. It's a quick fix to correct that.The charging port is not waterproof by any stretch. In fact, I seriously doubt that it's moisture proof because the flap that covers the charging port is not a tight seal. Most waterproof charging port flaps on competing brands have a protruding rubber piece that inserts into the port, providing a dual layered seal. This has one too, but it's not tightly fitted to seal the port.Where I think mine may have been the victim of substandard parts and/or manufacturing are: the barrel connector does not stay in contact with the charging port. Any movement, however slight, will stop the charging process. Plus some of the buttons do not provide the level of tactile feedback that waterproof ones do. Some on this device do and some do not.General operation: it's not loud enough to compete with my shower, but the sound is very clear and the high, mid and low range frequency responses are very respectable.Bottom line: I am willing to concede that the manufacturing issues I listed are one-off flukes. However, there are some design issues that need to be corrected. When those are addressed this could be a five star speaker.

This model eliminates that.When I mentioned that this is relatively capacity I am putting it into the context of the high capacity batteries that seem to have flooded the market this year. Although it's low it can still add a lot of use time to your phone (or even tablet). I usually multiply claimed capacities of these batteries by .9 to get a more realistic charging capacity.

Not too tight, not too loose, and this cable synchs without any issues. Most cables will charge, but synching with non-Apple gear can be problematic. As others have mentioned, the MFi certification is a big plus as well, and adds even more value because you know this is not some fly-by-night company that flood the bargain bins.

It was also difficult to find a spot that the mount would affix to that was flat enough and allowed access to the phone.Which I have yet to be able to do.So, although I'm sure it works great for some, it does not work for all.

It attaches nicely but I've realized that I was spoiled by my old phone holder. This holder does a nice job in locking your phone in so quick removal is difficult. I guess we should all be using a bluetooth but I don't always have it on. So when I need to grab my phone out of the phone mount, it is a tight struggle. My old phone holder (that went with my old phone) had arms on the sides that the phone slid in and out of easily. So I'm afraid I'm used to just slipping the phone up with little resistance.

It is fast, has a great screen, terrific touch sensitivity, and runs a ton of apps. The only problem I've been having, but I think it is the same with any mobile device these days, is that Adobe Flash isn't making a mobile version anymore so there are things that don't run (internet based) since they require the latest version of Flash. I have added Google Chrome as a browser since the preloaded browser was sometimes limiting. I still love this and have found it is comfortable, a great size, and durable.UPDATE: Almost four weeks later and I still love it. It seems to be very stable, no lock-ups, app crashes or anything. Battery is great. With moderate daily use, I still often have 50% power by the end of the day. Still recommended! Another bonus is the voice recognition. It is a huge step up from my first Incredible. Hardly ever misses and is really easy to use. Navigation, google searches, texting, email, etc. - it is so much easier and intuitive.My first smartphone was the first Droid Incredible. I had it for over two years and got used to the great feel of the HTC skin and input. But it had glitches. When I went to replace it, I ended up with a Razr (Motorola). I really liked the screen (huge) and the navigation and apps that came with the phone. But, alas, it wasn't meant to be as it landed face down on a brick step after only two months. I was really pleased with it (with a couple of small exceptions) so it was my intention to get the same phone. However, besides the fact that the Razr was more expensive that the Incredible 4G at this time the sales clerk mentioned that the Incredible has terrific battery life and is much newer technology. So why go backwards?With apprehension, I decided on the Incredible 4G knowing I could swap it out for a Razr in a few days if I hated it. However, there is no way they are getting it back! I love it.I was concerned that the screen was smaller than the Razr but it hasn't been a problem. You seem to adjust and the size difference is actually a benefit. I had trouble holding the Razr (shoulder to ear) since it was larger and very thin. The Incredible is great since, although it is still fairly thin, it is a smaller, more convenient size and sits comfortably whether holding it or crooking it in your neck. (which is not really the best thing to do I  realize but let's face it, we all do it).The screen is a great resolution and everything is crystal clear and easy to read. The battery life is great. I've been playing a lot with it and although I charge it up every night, it seems to maintain a good charge for a long time. Something to point out is that some phones are soldering the battery to the motherboard which makes a hard reset difficult -- especially when your phone locks up. You can't take the battery out to complete one. The Incredible has a removable battery giving you the flexibility you need for resets.What I really like about it (which I didn't like on the Razr) is the sensitivity of the screen, especially the keypad. The Razr wasn't as intuitive in finger placement and it often typed the wrong letter even though I was pretty sure I was on it or just to the edge. The Incredible is so sensitive, it's been really easy to text, type, search, etc. while using the keypad. Once you have something better, it is easy to remember how frustrating something was before.It is fast! I get around very quickly and the 4G, which I already had with the Razr, is great.Another thing I really like is the skin. The options are great, personalization is easy to navigate. Icons are fun/professional. Navigation is really intuitive and easy. At the bottom is a back arrow, home button, and a 'recent apps' icon, which allows you to scroll through and quickly jump to a recent or frequent app.It's got another feature (that I probably won't use) which allows you to drag icons, documents, apps, whatever, into a single icon folder. You can then have a bunch of icons in one space slot and not take up a lot of screen keeping them separate. It creates a folder of apps or documents which you can then name. It shows four icons inside but you can put as many as you want.It has a double camera, front or back, which seems to take pretty good photos and of course you can take video.I like the screen when you first turn it on. You can slide to unlock or there are four icons that you can drag to the unlock dot to instantly launch that app. So if you get a mail notification, you can just quickly slide the mail icon to the bottom of the screen and when the phone unlocks, it is open to mail.So I really like the sensitivity of the touch screen - very nice, the size is small and convenient, the battery life is great, and the navigation is really easy to use and intuitive.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Responsive, Comfortable - A Great Phone","unixReviewTime":1342742400,"reviewTime":"2012-07-20T00:00:00"}

It's hard to believe there are so many features packed into one well-priced product.The first thing you have to do is pair the Incredisonic up with your phone. My Droid Incredible 4G found it easily. Then match the FM frequency on the device to the FM frequency on your radio. Try to find one that is clear from any local stations. I used the default setting at 87.9.From there, the options are great:Answer your calls hands free -- It automatically chimes when you get a call. Answer the call and your caller is heard through the speakers in your car. I was told that, although they knew they were on speaker phone, I was clear and easy to hear. No headset to wear, easy to use and the volume works both on the device and on your car stereo.Listen to your cloud music -- I logged into my cloud drive and started playing. The music sounded great (as great as my car speakers were capable of producing) and I had a clear, no interference stream of music. You can forward or repeat using your phone but the Incredisonic also has advance and reverse buttons for moving ahead or backwards in your track order.Listen to your iPod -- (or any mp3 device). Use the provided cord to attach your iPod to the Incredisonic and clearly play any playlist, song or audio book. You cannot use the track advance with your iPod though.Use it as a car mount -- This is probably the one area that I wasn't as thrilled with. It has a pretty sturdy horizontal mount, padded edge with a pressure bar. But since the Incredisonic plugs into your car charger, the added weight of the phone makes it a little wobbly at times. I also don't always like to have my phone in landscape mode.As just one more benefit, there is also a place to charge a USB product using your own USB cable.There is an on/off switch on the front of the car charger portion, an easy to read display, and it gives audible cues when it pairs with your phone and/or answers a call. I was really impressed with the clarity of the signal through the car speakers. I have an FM receiver that I've used for my iPod in the past and it's been spotty on the clarity.

I've done it and the feeling of panic is not good. This power bank is a great way to get the juice you need for your electronic devices. The RAVPower Dynamo-On-the-Go power bank is packed with a ton of back-up power. It takes quite awhile to charge but using the AC adapter instead of USB to computer plug is faster (all are provided). The unit has two cables and two USB ports for charging two items at a time. The end of each cable is a micro USB plug. The instructions state that if you have a device with a different charging port, you can use your own USB cable with the correct end plug to your device. This is actually nice for me because most of my devices are micro USB so I only have what I need. I don't have a bunch of extra plugs hanging around.The power bank charged up my Droid Incredible 4G easily and also a completely drained Kindle Fire. It still had one (out of four) power bars left so I still had juice left over. I'm not an expert on power levels so I can't translate that to how much power was exchanged.The power bank comes with a velvety bag that easily holds your unit, cables, and AC plug. Some power banks have a built in light but this does not.

The biggest problem I have with it is that it has a huge range and if I get too close to my car while talking on my phone without the headset -- sometimes 50 or more feet away -- the headset picks up and I've \"lost\" the call. I have to quickly turn off bluetooth to get them back.**I've had headsets that cost $20 up to $120. To-date I've been disappointed with just about all of them. Some of them break or stop charging after a few months, most I can't be heard clearly and I can't get them positioned comfortably.But who wants to drive around with a big old headset like this on. I will. Purely because it works so I will use it more often and therefore drive hands free. So who cares about how it looks.At first I was a little uncomfortable about where the headset sits around the top of your head. I don't think my head is huge but I'm not sure it will fit the biggest heads around - although it is adjustable and really, just needs to stay on top.I like how easy it is to use. It charged in a few hours, paired easily and has been consistent in performance.It has a very comfortable foam ear piece that doesn't sit inside your ear. I can never get the other ones to sit well inside my ear. The boom mic is easy to position and shape so that it sits just to the side of your mouth. The cord is connected to the controls for volume, call answer, disconnect and voice activation. If you hold the power button for a couple of seconds, it will ask you what you want. Then you can ask to \"Dial XXX-XXXX\" or \"Call Mary on mobile\" and it will repeat what you've asked (most of the time being right) and initiate the call. I only wish there was a way to confirm or stop the suggested call. So if it comes up with the wrong one, it just starts dialing anyway. I would like to be able to say, \"yes\" or \"no\" before it dials.The control has an quick clip that attaches to your shirt or seat belt making it easily accessible. The headset has an auto on feature when you pick it up an place it on your head. Otherwise, it stays in stand by when laying down.The charging plug is a micro USB and the one that comes with it fits the opening with a little curve to keep it flush as it is plugged in.The sound is clear and seems to eliminate all the background junk that other headsets pick up.It is comfortable to wear while driving and I feel so much better using that than trying to hold a phone (or not talk at all) or keep repositioning a smaller earpiece (which ultimately I take out since others keep telling me they can't hear me.) I also like if I'm on a call at home or in the office and I don't want to keep cricking my neck holding the phone in place.So I am thrilled that I finally have a headset that I have NO hesitation using. Worth the investment for a high quality, well-designed and comfortable headset.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Clear, Easy to Use, Best Headset I've Had to Date","unixReviewTime":1359331200,"reviewTime":"2013-01-28T00:00:00"}

It is rather large and bulky as powerbanks go but I do like that the power button is clearly visible and accessible on the side. The Maxboost Pulse charges two devices at one time (although it only comes with one power cord but you can use your own USB cables). It also comes with three plugs to switch out on the power cord: micro USB, Macro USB and the older 52 pin Apple.It is heavy and bulky but it comes with a nice drawstring bag to store the bank and cords. It does not charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet but most power banks do not charge it. It does charge my smartphone, Kindle Fire and iPod very quickly, seemingly faster than a wall plug - which I found hard to believe but it was true.A solid unit with a lot of stored power.

OtterBox seemed to have it all: a case, screen protector and belt clip all in one.For the price, this is a great buy. But it added so much bulk to my phone. It was uncomfortable for me. The case I now have adds an eighth of an inch on all sides. The OtterBox adds a quarter inch to each side, half an inch per longer and half an inch wider. That is a lot when you are already working with a wide phone.

It has square edges and brushed metal accents. I was also taken aback at how big and heavy it was. I was thinking, really, there are more compact and sleek designs than this. But then, I started charging things. I used it exclusively to charge my Droid Incredible 4G LTE for a week. And the battery pack was still at 75% power. Wow. That would have drained most battery packs to nothing. I used it to charge a Kindle fire, same slow drain with little impact on the amount of juice left in my heavy metal brick. It did not charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet.It comes with two cables, one shorter, one longer and four plugs including micro USB, mini USB, iPod (30-pin) and PSP. Or you can use your own USB device cable.What I like: HUGE power capacity. Love the battery remaining percentage. It gives you a clear indication of how much battery is left. It charges two devices at a time.What I don't like: it is heavy and big. I would be a lot to take for a long airplane trip although the benefit is that you don't have to carry a couple of smaller banks. It does not have a carry case to keep all the parts together. The box says it has a built-in flashlight but it does not have one. However, I couldn't imagine carrying this around to use as a flashlight.For the price, this beast packs a ton of power.

With 7800mAh, I can get about three full charges for my phone or two charges for my Kindle Fire.It comes with probably the nicest carry bag I've ever seen for a powerbank. It is a double lined soft case with a bead toggle to keep it closed. While that toggle may not keep the lose plugs ends inside, it will keep the powerbank and a cable inside safely. You can use the included cable with any of the four more commonly used plugs or your own USB cable. It has one more added benefit which is a moderate level LED light that runs for a long time on the powerbank battery.I was provided a unit for evaluation and review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Compact, Fast Charging Powerbank","unixReviewTime":1393718400,"reviewTime":"2014-03-02T00:00:00"}

Some work well but don't look like they will hold up. Others look great but don't work very well. This power bank has it all. It looks great and works great.It is a big power bank physically and in comparison to some other 12000mAh banks, it is probably one of the larger ones. But it is packed with power and features.First of all, it comes in some really cool packing, all recyclable and double 'wrapped' with a belt of tri-colored elastic around it. It has a four light system that shows how much power is left in the bank. A little shake and it displays. 12000mAh is a lot of power for tablets, smartphones or other small devices. I used it exclusively to charge my smartphone for a few days and it still showed four LED lights. I've also used it to charge my Kindle Fire but it will not charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Not too many power banks will do that. It has an on board (but fully removable) USB to micro USB cable that sits snugly at the end of the unit. I had trouble using this cable for my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone with a thick case on it because the end of the micro USB is pretty chunky and it didn't fit. But I have plenty of other cables.I think it took more than 7 hours to charge to capacity - I plugged it in the evening and it was still charging up in the morning, more than 7 hours later.In comparison to other power banks with the same capacity, it is around the same price of other good quality power banks.I have the Khaki Brown and it has a great feel. Soft, round edges and a slightly rough finish so that it doesn't slip out of your hand. I like the quick charging, the amount of power stored in the bank and the great design.I was provided a sample for testing and review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Tons of Power, Great Design","unixReviewTime":1395964800,"reviewTime":"2014-03-28T00:00:00"}

The screen is completely exposed and all ports - speaker, mic, charging, camera, headset - are clearly exposed.I've been using a much bigger case before using this and can see benefits and some usage drawbacks to a flip case so it is really all about how you use your phone.A flip case is thin and neat, It not only protects the back of your phone but the glass front as well. It is professional looking and comfortable in  my hands. There is nothing to hinder access to the charging port that some bulkier cases can create.But a flip case means that if you want your phone open,  you will always have a cover to either flip over or lay flat. Taking a photo means holding the cover out to the side. If you want to put it in a car mount, you have to flip the cover over and even then it can be difficult to hold it in place. If you like to sit in a meeting and see all notifications as they come in, you'll have to keep your cover open. It will not fit into a belt clip either.So if you like the idea of a flip case, this is a really nice one. Great for a man or woman, looks professional in any business situation and will drop into a pocket, briefcase or purse without the threat of cracking or scratching the glass.Update: I just took one star off the rating because after using this for awhile, I noticed a smell coming from the pockets area. I'm not sure what it is but it smells like overheating electronics. I thought it was my phone but it isn't.

It's sleek, with a low profile.  The base is weighted so it stays in one place.  One doesn't see lights unless the lights are on.  Otherwise, the whole unit looks uniformly black.The only lights that are visible when the handset is on the base is the tiny charging light and the equally small Bluetooth light, both of which are a soft glowing white.  They are unobtrusive at night.As a charging station for my iPhone 4S, it's wonderful.  It comes with a universal charging adapter for the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4.  What I like about this dock is I don't have to take my phone out of the case to place it on the dock.  To make it fit, I just don't use the adapters.As for the handset, sound quality is best when the phone and the handset are in the same room as the dock.  Separating either one too far from the dock and we get a lot of static or interference.  Even one room over can be a problem, so it's not as good as using a cordless phone.SOLUTION FOR SOME PROBLEMSThe manual was not very helpful for some of the problems I encountered, so I will share some of my solutions with you that worked for me.  Keep in mind, I have an iPhone 4S.  This may not work for everyone:iPhone NOT AUTO-RECONNECTING:1) Unpair the handset.2) Turn off the handset.3) Place the handset on the dock.4) While the handset is on the dock, press and hold the power button (MFB) until you hear a tone.5) Turn on the handset and pair your phone.HANDSET HAS NO SOUNDS:Go to settings --> general --> accessibility --> incoming calls --> choose \"headset.\"I know the accessibility on my phone was initially set on \"default\" and that did not work.  Changing it to \"headset\" and then later switching back to \"default\" somehow did the trick so that I no longer have to worry about getting sound over the handset.CONCLUSIONI use this dock more as a charging station for my phone than for the handset.  The handset is more comfortable to hold than the phone, but I'm stuck using it in the bedroom (where the dock is), so it's not as convenient to use.  It is very elegant.  It looks pretty sitting on my nightstand.  I just wish it had more range.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Solutions to some problems","unixReviewTime":1346371200,"reviewTime":"2012-08-31T00:00:00"}

That means I don't have to worry if I lose that connector.  Just use another micro-USB cord for charging.The PowerGen 5200 comes with one USB port to charge my devices.  That is common for a battery pack of this capacity.  More powerful battery packs usually have two ports to simultaneously charge two devices.  Also included on the unit is one LED bulb flashlight that I find comes in handy.This is a great battery pack for charging phones and the Kindle 3G.  It will work for a Kindle Fire, but I'd recommend something in the 8000 mAh range for that.  For an iPad, I recommend 10000 mAh or higher.Of all the battery packs I own, this is the one I choose to carry with me.  Its compact size and sleek look has won me over.

I have a Kindle Fire and a Kindle 3G. They sometimes run out of juice when I'm on the go. I simply plug this little battery in and recharge them. It's so convenient. It's about the size of an empty wallet, which makes it completely portable.So far, I've found that if I really want to fully charge my Kindle Fire with the Incredicharge, it takes hours and completely drains the Incredicharge. I can use the Fire as it's charging, but I don't if I want to get the full charge and get it more quickly.The Kindle 3G charges faster than the Fire. We went camping last night. I plugged in the Kindle 3G, tended a fire for a short while, got ready for bed and before I knew it, it went from fully discharged to half charged. I'd say that all took about an hour and my Incredicharge still has 3/4 charge left. Even though it's fully capable of completely recharging my Kindle 3G, I used it more like a backup until I could get home. I never know when I'll need that spare battery for some other device. It's a precious commodity!The Incredicharge set comes with a short USB cord and seven different mobile phone connectors:- Sony Ericsson- iPhone- Nokia- mini USB- PSP- Samsung- micro USBAnother extra tidbit, it comes with a built in LED flashlight. It's just one LED light, but nevertheless helpful in a jam.To recharge the Incredicharge, simply plug it into a USB port on the computer or a powered USB hub. It can also be plugged into the USB wall plugs. It just can't be plugged into an outlet directly. For some, this may be an inconvenience.My only disappointment is no connector is included for the Nintendo DS Lite or 3DS. We need to supply our own DS Lite or 3DS USB cords. Basically, we can use any USB cords, including the one that it comes with. The unit has two USB ports that can be used at the same time. Another added convenience.If they could include a pouch for all the pieces, that would be icing on the cake. I love this charger. I take it everywhere with me. Silly me, I'm letting my gadgets run out of juice just to have an excuse to use it. Overall, a solid product.PROS:* small, compact, portable* two USB ports* comes with many different adapters (see above)* LED flashlight* can fully charge a Kindle Fire* can recharge the Incredicharge by connecting to a powered USB port* can use own USB cord to charge devicesCONS:- cannot recharge Incredicharge by plugging directly into an outlet- no Nintendo DS Lite or 3DS adapter included- no pouchThis product was provided for review by JR Closeouts; but it's been proven so useful, I went and bought another one as a gift._____________________________________UPDATE 5/26/12: I have been using this battery regularly to recharge my Kindle 3G. I just set it and forget about it. The battery recharges the Kindle 3G until it's finished charging and then turns off.

My very first impression is that it looked like a case for a Kindle Fire.  Open it up and it has three panels.

I know instructions say direct sunlight, but I didn't want something screaming \"electronic device\" staring out the front window of my car.  That didn't work.Next, I tried putting it in the window of my home office.  This is a south facing window which gets very bright, though not direct, sunlight.  On this morning, it happened to be overcast.  I tried charging my children's spy watch.  No go.The sun came out and I decided I needed to go all out and put it in direct sunlight with the spy watch.  Voila!  A very quick charge.  It works!Now, since it was so bright outside, I tried charging both my Kindle 3G and myIncredicharge I-5000 External Battery Packthrough the front office window at the same time.  The Incredicharge charged extremely slowly.  The Kindle 3G still would not charge.Again, I brought the Instapark outside to charge the Incredicharge Battery in direct sunlight.  Whoa!

Yes, it did charge, a little, very slowly.  After a full day, my Kindle 3G went from critically low battery levels to half charged.So, this Instapark Solar Charger does work very well for some devices.  It really does need direct sunlight.  It doesn't work so well in shaded or cloudy conditions.  I think I need something with a little more oomph to charge my Kindle 3G.

It's larger than the 5200 mAh cousins and smaller/more lightweight than the 10000 mAh battery packs.I prefer the 8400 mAh battery packs because they have enough juice to charge up my Kindle Fire from critically low to full charge with enough juice left over for another partial charge.

Not all chargers give us a choice.  The cords come with six adapters (Playstation Portable, Nokia, mini-USB, TWO micro-USB, iPhone/iPad).  Two micro-USB adapters are necessary, believe it or not.  It is the most used adapter and I bent one on a battery pack from a different maker (which did not supply me with a spare).2)  If I lose the charging cord, I can still charge my battery pack.  The battery pack uses a standard micro-USB connection.  Yes, some battery packs use a proprietary cord.  I'm thankful this does not.3)  PowerGen comes with a USB wall adapter, so we can plug this into an outlet.  Some brands only come with a USB cord for charging.4)  PowerGen comes with two USB ports (0.6 Amps and 2 Amps) for charging your devices.  Yes, you can charge two devices at once!Other features PowerGen and all my batteries have include a handy LED light, power indicators, and automatic shut-off when not connected to devices.

I don't do that, because my power outlet on my Honda Odyssey is so low that I would have to look down and take my eyes off the road every time I glance at the map.SETUPSetup was easy.  I plugged it into the power socket and it worked.  The station was already set to an unused frequency.  All I needed to do was pair my iPhone, which wasn't difficult.  After that, the phone automatically pairs when the transmitter is on.My phone sits securely in the spring-grip cradle.  I don't ever worry about it falling out.  The gooseneck arm bends and twists so my phone can look at me from any direction, landscape or portrait.It has a USB port, so I don't need to worry about my cell phone battery draining as I continuously play music through my radio.

There are control buttons on the transmitter to make phone calls, play the last song, etc.  They work well for when my phone is in my purse, but I prefer to use the controls on my iPhone when it's on the cradle.The FM transmitter is such a wonderful way to listen to music.  If you have a large library of music on your phone, you won't need your local radio stations anymore.  If you're like me, Pandora has never been better.

It is the only charger I own that attempts one. On the cord are little blue magnetic clips that attach to the charger itself, so we can wrap the cord around the charger and secure. On my unit, the clips were both facing in the same direction, which made it awkward to wrap the cord neatly. I was able to open one clip and reposition it so they were facing the opposite direction. That way, I can secure them as in the photo on the Amazon product page. The magnetic clips work when the unit is sitting still in a car or on a desk; but in a purse, the cord easily slips off. It needs stronger magnets for a more secure hold, but I give Energizer kudos for trying.Multiple adapters are standard with larger emergency chargers. The Energizer charger one only comes with a micro-USB cable. If your device does not have a micro-USB port, you must supply the USB cord for your device.This Energizer charger is the least powerful one I own. At 2500 mAh, it can fully charge my iPhone or my Kindle 3G once before it needs to be recharged. I've been carrying it around in my purse with me and giving it heavy usage during my vacation. Personally, I like more powerful chargers that can manage a few iPhone charges before dying. I want one that will fully charge a Kindle Fire. At the very least, I recommend a 5000 mAh charger. For a Fire, I prefer at least 8000 mAh. For an iPad, at least 10000 mAh. Keep in mind that the higher the mAh, the larger and heavier the charger. If you want something lightweight, don't care for a myriad of adapters, don't need a lot of power, this one will work just fine.UPDATE 11/20/12: I would like to add that this charger takes a very long time to recharge.

I think I've only used one that was below expectations.  Most come with a variety of connectors, a charging cable, an embedded LED flashlight.  In those respects, the Yubi Power 5200 mAh meets all standards.FORM FACTORPower banks get smaller all the time.  I remember when 5000 mAh was the size of a small wallet, and I thought that was small.  This one is getting close to the size of some 2500 mAh power banks I've owned.  It is small enough to fit in my jean pocket, a good size for a purse.CONNECTORSManufacturers sometimes go crazy over providing every connector imaginable.  Only a few will ever be used.  Yubi Power provides the most common adapters needed:* iPhone 30 pin connector* micro USB* mini USB* PSPA big plus for providing the iPhone connector.  Only about half the power banks come with one.If your device charges via a USB port but doesn't use one of those connectors, you can connect with your own USB cord.CAPACITY5200 mAh is a good capacity for general purposes.  I prefer it over a 2500 mAh power bank, because it will charge an iPhone more than once.  After charging my iPhone twice, it still had one LED indicator light shining (less than 30% charge remaining).If you have an iPad or other large tablet, I would recommend a 10000 mAh power bank or higher; but for many people on the road, this will be fine.POWER INDICATOR LIGHTSThere are three power indicator lights.  I have to look to find the pinpoints of light.  On most other units, power indicator lights are much more visible.  Two pinpoints of light can indicate anywhere from 30% to 80% charge remaining, which is a wide margin.  The majority of power banks use four indicator lights for more precision.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSSome manufacturers will provide a short charging cord, some a long cord, and some will include both.  A short cord is good for on-the-go.  A long cord is not necessary, but I find it handy for charging the power bank.  This power bank comes with one short charging cord.No pouch is provided.  It is not standard issue, but a nice accessory to include.Like just about all power banks, this one will charge via a USB cord.  It does not come with a USB wall adapter, so you'll need to have a USB charging port available somewhere (computer, wall adapter, USB hub, etc.).  Only some power bank manufacturers will provide the wall adapter.  I find them unnecessary.PROS:+ includes four connectors, including an iPhone connector+ small size, fits in purse or pocket+ good capacity for general purposes, will charge my iPhone at least twice+ embedded LED flashlight+ includes short charging cordCONS:- only 3 power indicator lights- power indicator lights are pinpoint size- does not come with a long charging cord- no pouchSUMMARYThis is a very good basic set.

Well, when you're on the go and don't have a USB port handy to recharge your iPhone, iPad, or Bluetooth speaker, plug it into one of these. They're small enough to fit in a pocket or purse. Carry them around and charge your device while on a hike or navigating the crowds at Disneyland.Power banks come in many different sizes.

Others come with nothing but the bare minimum, or maybe they'll have accessories like a carry pouch, or added perks like an onboard LED light. Some have multiple USB ports, some have onboard charging cords.Pay attention to the amperage of the ports. They are usually either 1 or 2 amps.

In fact, it is not.  Unlike its cousin, this FRIEQ case comes with an earphone jack and an armband.WATERPROOFBoth cases are equally waterproof.  I tested that myself by submerging a cellphone in my hot tub for half an hour with each case.  The cell phone came out bone dry each time.The nice thing about the case is it floats.  If the case gets away from me somehow, it won't be sinking to the bottom of a murky lake.TAKING PHOTOSIf I want to take a lot of photos, theFRIEQ Universal Waterproof Caseis a better choice.  Both sides of that case are clear plastic, whereas the back of this case is mostly opaqe with a small window for the camera eye.  If the camera is not positioned correctly, the opaque part of the case will obstruct the view. Photos are acceptable, considering they are looking through plastic.  Of course, they are better when the phone is out of the case.TOUCHSCREENThe phone retains its touchscreen sensitivity through the case.  In fact, when I put the armband on, I am constantly accidentally activating the touchscreen.ACCESSORIESYou will have to supply your own earphones, which attach to the case behind the armband.  Music sounds fine through this setup.  I didn't try this underwater, because I would never listen to music through headphones while underwater.  I assume anyone using it this way is more worried about incidental wetness.The armband is nicer than the neckstrap, because I don't like the weight of a phone around my neck.  We do get a choice on how we wear it.  The armband is very long, so it wraps around my arm and around the case before securing.  I think it would be nice to have it shorter, so it wraps around just my arm.OVERALL IMPRESSIONI like this case for the armband.  I like the other FRIEQ case because it is clear on both sides so photos are easier to take.  I wouldn't often use the earphones, so the extra cord to attach the phone to the case just gets in the way.  I can see how it would be useful for others, though.I like it because it works.  I do a lot of gold panning, which is wet and muddy.  I need cases like these to keep my phone with me and dry.  I'm still debating which one to take with me next time I go.

Then, I discovered that switching to the USB cable that came with the Enerpak speeds up the connection immensely. It must have been the cable.

So, when charging the power bank, only four lights will light up to indicate a full charge.  When charging a device, the one light on the end will light up.

I paired it with both my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet and my iPhone without problems. Reconnecting is automatic on the iPhone. I just have to choose the device on the Fire.The Bluetooth range is excellent. I took my iPhone out of the bathroom, out the bedroom, down the stairs and the speaker still played.Battery life is great. I charged it once and two weeks later, it's still going. Mind you, I only turn it on while using the shower.All the controls work well. I can skip music, go back, pause, play, adjust volume . . . and answer the phone. I'm not sure who wants to answer the phone while in the shower. I imagine all the noise from the water would make it difficult for the person on the other end. Nevertheless, I tested it -- with the water off, as that's what I would do if I actually answered the phone in the shower. The sound from the speaker is excellent. I can hear the caller like I could directly on my cell phone. It's clear as can be. The other end is much more like from a speakerphone. It's a muddier sound, though it doesn't cut in and out. I suspect the echoing in the shower is the cause of that, but that's where it would be used, so that's where I tested it. Call back last number works. No Siri.The only problem I've discovered is the play button doesn't work on my Kindle Fire when I'm playing the Songza app (it will pause the music, but it won't restart the music). This is just app specific, because the play button does work with the mp3 music I have on the Kindle itself. I also have the Songza app on my iPhone and the play button works just fine there.Music sounds great coming out of this little thing.

After the applying, I thought I had a scratch on the Bionic Shield, but that scratch turned out to be a bubble in the shape of a scratch. It and the other tiny bubbles disappeared after a few days, just like directions said would happen.At the end of three weeks, the protector was smooth and clear, with the exception a tiny little chip along the edge of the Bionic Shield. I took off the screen protector and the screen underneath was completely unmarred and residue-free. That's important, because the maker never claimed it is bulletproof. It can get scratched, it can even crack. It is glass, after all. What it does do is protect the screen so that what happens to the Bionic Shield doesn't happen to the screen underneath.To recap:1) If you get little bubbles (there shouldn't be many and they are miniscule), they will go away.2) Some things that look like scratches may actually be bubbles.3) The screen protector is not bulletproof. It will scratch and crack like glass, but your screen is protected.This screen protector is beautiful. It looks just like the phone's native screen.

How convenient that I can use my phone to find my keys or my keys to find my phone.  My phone and fob will let know if they get separated so I don't lose either.  I could love it, if only there weren't so many glitches.  Where to begin . . . .PROBLEM #1This is a key fob that connects via Bluetooth to the Proximo app on my iPhone 4S.  The app must be on at all times.  If I turn off my app, my fob can't locate the phone.  Never turn off the app.PROBLEM #2We can designate \"quiet zones,\" where the phone won't make any noise when separated from the fob.  At home, for instance, I'm not worried about losing my phone to a thief or leaving it on a park bench.  In the quiet zones, I can still locate my phone by pressing the button on the fob or find my keys via the app.  Both the phone and the keys will sound off.However, if I leave the alarm mode on and enter a quiet zone, my phone will stay quiet but my fob will not.  If the fob gets separated from my phone, it will not remember to stay quiet.PROBLEM #3Location accuracy is very poor.  When I'm home (\"quite zone\"), it sometimes says I'm outside the home.  When I'm at the gym miles away, it says I'm inside the home.PROBLEM #4I drove home with the fob on and the Proximo on.  When I got into the garage, I turned off the app just to see what it would say for finding the last known location.  Apparently, it only occasionally scans the location, because the last known location wasn't my garage.  It was a couple of miles away.PROBLEM #5Although the fob and Proximo were on, I sometimes have trouble locating the phone.  Just today, I pressed the button on my fob.  The phone was right there, but nothing happened.  As I was checking to see if Proximo was on (it was), it sounded.  Opening the screen seemed to trigger it.  Like that would be something I could do when I can't find my phone.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSThe box shows icons for the car and pets.  I would not use this on my pets, unless they live indoors and I just want to find them around the house.  If they get out, the best we could do is find their last known location, which would be at home.  Also, it's not waterproof, as far as I can tell.  The fob might land in the water bowl when the pets are drinking.I guess the fob would work for cars.

I've found the Oxa Bluetooth watch useful when driving or when going someplace noisy where I can't hear my phone in my purse. It's good for any time holding a phone in my hand is not convenient.FORM FACTORMy wrist is small. This Bluetooth bracelet is not adjustable. I have to wear it higher up my arm to keep it still.The watch face is large and clunky, which is deceptive, because the digital display does not fill the screen. It's very small. In fact, I still can't tell what one of the icons is supposed to be.I can read the time (military time, we have no choice), but only if it is indoor lighting. Dimmer light is better. It's impossible to read outdoors, even in the shade.The watch charges with a proprietary cord that is very sensitive to being moved. I prefer the more universal micro USB cord. If I lose the charging cable, I would no longer be able to use my watch.BLUETOOTHIt was easy to pair with my iPhone 4S. Reconnection is automatic when I turn on the watch. Range is excellent. It is better than any other Bluetooth device that I own, which is a lot. When I go out of range, my watch vibrates to let me know a connection has been lost. If I come back within a short period (minutes), it will reconnect. If not, nothing happens.This watch is supposed to search for a signal every ten minutes. Not true.SOUNDIf you want to listen to music on your wrist, it's just okay. I don't think it was made for that. We get that small speaker quality.If you want to make and take calls, it's much better. My daughter helps me with a lot of my Bluetooth speakers, most of which have failed in the phone call department. This is the first one where the first words out of her mouth were, \"I love it!\"I have to say, I can hear her and every other caller just fine on this watch. They come in loud and clear. No one ever asks me to repeat myself, either. I went and tried it out as a caller and found that there is a slight echo when I talk, but it's not bad enough to prevent a conversation.The one thing I would like for phone calls is a way to set the ring on vibrate. In fact, I'd like to be able to set the watch to vibrate only for texts and everything else.

That's handy, much better than turning my Bluetooth speaker into a speakerphone.PHONE CALLSWhen I get calls on my HTC One, the Bolse speaker doesn't ring.  The cell phone does.  This is the only Bluetooth speaker I own that does that.  On all the other speakers, the ring comes through on the speaker.Then, there's the problem with the calls.  I can't figure out why some calls come through, some get rejected, and some go to voicemail.  I read the instructions, I tried to replicate the successful calls, but it seems somewhat random the results I get.  It is frustrating and not acceptable at all considering the selling point of this device.I can call out using the last number redial feature of the handset or just dialing out on my phone.  I can get a Google Voice search for different things on Google through the handset, but it doesn't call up a phone number for me or anything.When I get a connection, phone calls are clear from both ends.  There is a slight echo on my end lately that was not there the first time I used it.  For the most part, it's good enough.  Just remember to hang up using the multi-function button.MUSICThere is a lack of good volume for the speaker.  It's no louder than my cell phone.  In fact, I measured the volume for the cell phone at 76.6 dB at 1 foot away.  The speaker gives me 75.9 dB at 1 foot away.  I have the HTC One Harman Kardon edition, and that speaker beats the Bolse speaker in fullness and clarity any day.BLUETOOTHPairing is easy, and reconnection is automatic.

Our cabin was devoid of electricity, so I relied on this power bank.  Instructions note that the solar charging is just for emergencies, that it should not be left in the sun for prolonged periods of time.  I had to wonder what a consumer would expect buying a solar charging power bank if it weren't to be be left in the sun.  How long is too long?  So, I left it out to charge.  Seeing that the battery level was not moving up above one bar, I did what any normal person who doesn't read instructions would do and left it out all day, every day.  After a full day of bathing in the sun (sometimes shaded by trees but I tried to move it to full sun when I saw that), the power bank has enough juice to give my HTC One a 10% charge.I've had experience with larger solar chargers, so I didn't expect much more, though I did hope for it.  Even three and four panel fold-up chargers take a bit of time to fully charge a 5000 mAh power bank.  This power bank is the size of a large cell phone.  There just isn't enough surface area to catch the solar energy.  Instead, we can charge this power bank with a USB cable, which is what I do most of the time.  When it's fully charged, I can give my HTC One a 100% charge.This is a rugged power bank.  The ports are covered, and there's a carabiner for hanging off a backpack.

I have several sets of earphones but they are either bulky or requires to hook up a power adapter and audio cables.My current favorite before this purchase is an IR line of sight Sony.  It uses one \"AA\" battery which lasts for a very long time.  Another bonus is that the transmitter that you plug to the audio source also works as battery charger.  I also have a 900 Mhz Senheiser.

The bluetooth will only work if you have a bluetooth device.  For my purpose, this is excellent as you don't have any power adapter and audio cables to attach.  The 30-35 ft in the spec is accurate.  I did wander beyond 50 ft but the connection starts to fail at that point.  And when I turned across the corner, the music signal finally stopped.It has the power button, forward, volume control (- and +) located on the right ear.I also tried it on my iPhone and it works fine.  The music will stop when you get a call and just a push of a button to accept.

This is not because there is something wrong with the product, but putting a screen protector is quite difficult to achieve a perfect result.  Lint and dust are always a problem.I first cleaned the iPhone screen with an optical spray applied on a piece of cloth, and then gave several gusts of air from a compressed gas duster.  I was able to align the protector almost perfectly but I got several bubbles.  I repeated the process and almost got it the next time.  On the third attempt, I was satisfied after pushing the bubbles to the side.  Pushing the bubbles with the cardboard only works if there is no speck of dust or lint under the screen.The matte screen really helps with the glare; it is also less susceptible to fingerprints.  When my kids play with grease on their hands, I just wipe it off and cleans easily.What you get:3 matte/anti-glare screen protectors, small cloth, and a small piece of cardboard to push the bubbles out.

The voice command instructs you how and what to do from the beginning, like turning on your Bluetooth, putting the 4 digit access numbers, etc. You can operate it handsfree by voice command. You just need to memorize a few basic command words to interact with the unit. The caller ID is announced through the speakers by the caller's name or the phone number if name is not available.The wire hooks at the back for attaching it to you car visor is very secured. All the buttons that you need are easily accessible. The only button that is harder to reach is the on/off button located on the right side, but there is no reason to use it as it has a 40-day standby time. Talk time is 14 hours. It charges by USB supplied cable and cigarette adapter. A home wall AC adapter is not included, but you can use your phone USB AC adapter or plug it directly to your PC.One of its best features is sound quality. For a 5\" x 4.5\" x 3/4\" unit, it has 3 speakers that produce powerful and excellent audio. What it lacks is a physical audio input so you can attach your MP3 player directly. It can only play music via Bluetooth which may not give you the full range.As a Car Audio Transmitter:The FM function is not a radio receiver for radio stations; it is a transmitter to stream from your audio player/MP3 phone to your car radio using the FM.

No need to fumble on your phone to press any buttons. This all happens in mere seconds.You can also use this inside your home if you are doing some chores; my wife used it when she prepared meal at the kitchen. As long as her phone is within the Bluetooth range (which is about 30 ft), the speakerphone works fine, loud and clear.Cons:The Bluetooth is very sensitive. It stays connected even if we go inside the house. This causes two problems:- drains the battery unnecessarily.- makes you miss calls as you don't hear the ring as it is ringing in the car.One solution is to turn off your Bluetooth on your phone.Included is a free 59$ value Voice Assist for 1 year to correspond with emails, Facebook or Twitter.","overall":4.0,"summary":"2 in 1 device.

But no worry, it is not like that it will get stuck there forever; I have to remove and place it back a couple of times to make sure the camera hole is aligned. I like the idea of a folio as it protects both front and the back.  The inside part is suede which definitely will protect the glass of the phone.My main complaint is that the material is too thin (On the other hand this works both ways.  Good because it makes your iPhone remain thin but at the same time not that good as it doesn't provide ample protection for bigger falls.) It has a picture where it stands sideways, it can do that, but it is awkward. The closer is a tiny latch with magnets. It works but it seems a bit on the flimsy side.Anyway, as there are not many cases around (at the time this review was written) for the iPhone 5 and I need to protect my phone right away, I ordered it.Update: this is made of faux leather (artificial leather).

The battery for the new iPhone has 1440mAh capacity; this charger can charge it 1.5 times.The indicator light is a bit confusing.

The pouch can be handy as it can also accommodate your smartphone's cable together with the battery. Has a 30-second auto-off feature; once you unplug your gadget, the juice pack will automatically turns off.

This is the first I one I have tried (and I have tried so many FM transmitters before, each time  hoping the next one is better than the last one) that is not plagued with static and interference. It is robust and it performs solidly without any interruption.  The audio has to go through Bluetooth before channeling it to FM transmission, two wireless routes before it can play audio to your car speakers - which is quite impressive.  I play music using an iPhone 5, the sound quality is superb, well balanced with thumping bass.Paring is relatively easy.  I didn't even have to put in any password.  The IFM-500 has only 4 buttons, the two at the bottom are for back and forward arrows.  The top left is for telephone and the top right Bluetooth.  Bluetooth paring button is the top right.  In the middle is the orange LED screen that shows the radio frequency you are currently using. Just to the left is USB port.  This charges my phone via USB cable.  It can also be used to charge other electronic devices (GPS, digital cameras, etc.) as long as you have the cable with you.  There is a 3.5 mm aux jack at the bottom if you need to play an MP 3 player without Bluetooth.Calls are OK.  Along with my phone, it stops the music automatically when receiving calls.  I can clearly hear my wife on the speakers (although she says  I have to speak up a little bit).  I can use Siri to make calls.Cons:- the goose neck has limited position.  With the phone attached, it is heavy that I have to prop the phone on the front of the car stereo (my car is a 2001 Honda Accord - sedan) so it won't bend when I push the phone buttons.  I also need to be careful when I am shifting gears. The 12v cigarette lighter on the Accord is too close that I can hit this gizmo and my phone with my knuckles while shifting to low gears.

The front grill has three buttons, the plus and minus signs are for volume, and the square sign (multifunction button) is for pairing.

I am not new to glass protectors though, and since I have been introduced to them, I am not going back to plastic screen protectors anymore.  First of all, it is almost impossible to have a complete bubble free and lint free application with a plastic screen protector.  With glass protectors, just make sure that your phone screen is clean (using the included microfiber cloth) and you can put a glass protector painless without any bubbles.You get the complete kit, cleaning wipe, microfiber cloth, deducting strips and a blue static cling.  Once you are sure that the surface of the phone is clean, carefully peel off the plastic from the glass protector and then lay it carefully making sure all the holes are in the right places.  Gently tap the center and the screen protector will stick itself onto your phone.You wont feel any change in the phone's responsiveness.  It is still as quick as if you don't have any protector at all.  In fact, you won't hardly notice that there is a screen protector at all.

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. Lumia 900 has been succeeded by Nokia Lumia 920.  For someone interested in a first smartphone which doesn't break the purse, Lumia 900 is an excellent choice. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Lumia 900 has 4.3\" (109 mm) 800x480 resolution 217 ppi 16m compared to the Lumia 920 which has a 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 16 GB storage and 512 MB RAM compared to Lumia 920 which has 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  Lumia 900 has 8 MP camera and 720 p video compared to Lumia 920 which has a 8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.4 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor compared to Lumia 920 which has a 1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass  compared to Lumia 920 which has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.As you can see Lumia 920 has, what I would say incremental upgrades over 900 but nothing earth shattering. Lumia 900  as well as 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 1830 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 900 as well as 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.  Lumia 900 has Bluetooth 2.1, whereas  Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Lumia 900 has the diagnostic tool. It can be obtained by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.On this diagnostic tool one can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It's also possible to perform all the tests in one run. This is really cool to have this power at the user's hand!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 900 is certainly the best and cheapest Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market, it was really the best in 2012, but if you don't mind the budget get the 920 or 820 (for microSD card slot).","overall":5.0,"summary":"Best Phone in 2012, Still in the run","unixReviewTime":1369008000,"reviewTime":"2013-05-20T00:00:00"}

Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Best Windows Phone as of early 2013","unixReviewTime":1368835200,"reviewTime":"2013-05-18T00:00:00"}

Same phone with a different chipset is used for Sprint/Verizon.When one opens the box, there is a sense of awe. People ask \"Is this really a phone\" was one reaction I got. It is an amazing piece of hardware. I have used Android devices starting from Cupcake version, used iPhone, HP Veer with webOS, Windows 7.5 HTC Titan 2. This phone is the sleekest and one of the best so far. It is fabulous!  I find the big size to be very good and not a problem at all. Will the Galaxy Note 3 be 6\" ?!The manual pdf is definitely a must read, there are lot of tips in the manual that comes in handy. For example motion based sensors are extraordinary. Closing the phone with palm silences it. Sliding palm takes a screenshot. There are several such examples. Read the manual.Out of the box, connect to wireless and get the phone logged into Google account. The advantage of Android phones is that once you are logged into Google universe, everything gets synced up especially if you have been using Android.  The position of power button is at an excellent position for your hand on this Note 2. The additional LED for notification on top is very handy. Listen Apple? The camera serves some really futuristic ideas also. It can check if you are looking at the phone and disable screen lock (even if you set timeout to say 30 sec). Also it can serve as password unlock. Amazing! These can be set from Settings Menu.The Android version as of Oct 26 2012 is Jellybean 4.1.1. Kernel version is 3.0.31-259982. Model GT-N7100. I got the 64 GB microSD card. Get this mobileUltra, it is the latest as of Oct 2012. (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging. Settings show an available space of 59.45 GB. So along with 16 GB built (system shows only around 10.46 GB), my Note 2 has 80 GB memory. With music in the  Google Music cloud, I intent to use the memory for video/pictures as a camcorder/camera.I strongly suggest going through Settings and customizing many things as per your desire. I did Voice Input, Keyboard (this comes with English(UK), change to English(US) for example. Fiddle around the settings and you will be amazed how much you can customize. I also did Battery % to appear in notification bar.One thing I found the default keyboard did not show Mic button. I realized it was next to Sym button. Long press it and choose Mic. And then on, it will appear in default keyboard. Also customize the accent. It can do magic for typing. I type paragraphs at a time effortlessly. This is Google backend servers at work. The Mic on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 does a fantastic job!S-Pen, Ah.. I was truly impressed. You have to use these to believe it. The note taking was very fluid. Samsung seem to have nailed it. I wrote up an equation in Equation mode - x^5 = x^2 + 2x + .... Something completely random, another one d/dx(an equation) and it recognized perfectly and asked it to search, it went to Wolfram Alpha and solved it. It is at first unbelievable and then it starts to sink in this is a computer program made well. Like it should be in first place! Export to pdf is very good. The main thing is the pen is very fluid and feels like a fountain pen writing.Overall, the phone feels very smooth and snappy. The screen is crisp and clear. Apps can even be multi screened. Samsung approved apps can be placed two in a screen. Eg. Maps on top and email on bottom portion. I doubt I will use this, but handy.One gripe I have with this phone is speaker is on the back. Typically if you lie the phone down, the speaker is blocked on bottom. I wish the speakers were in the side. This is a design decision and not sure why phones have speaker on back. But the speaker volume is very high, so I am not complaining too much.One big pain point with Android is once you purchased/downloaded for free Apps, they cannot be permanently deleted. So even if you get a junk app, and delete immediately they are permanently there in your Google Play store. From the phone's play store I got 300+ Apps. One cannot choose 50 apps and say get all these. You have to do one by one. After getting one, the screen resets to beginning. So I went to a computer browser and pushed apps to pone. This is easier and faster.UPDATE:  In Jelly bean, you have a circle with a / and pressing it prompts a pop up to delete. After delete it reverts to top of the list again. Why dont they go to same spot. I have hundreds, so it is a pain, nevertheless good feature. I will delete few every day!Some of apps I have as of now :Amazon MobileAndroid Status : Android Status app shows ARMv7, Max Freq 1.6 GHz, BogoMips 1592.52 Memory 1.79 GB, Free 365 MB, Internal Storage 10.46 GB Free 7.18 GB.

It was too much I had to reduce it. Will be useful for several use cases, in cars, kitchen, home, if you need for some small house performances etc. No issues. I was able to keep the phne charged and take the speaker to a different room and still play. I tried with a tablet and can keep browsing/doing some work while my daughter listens in a different room.BATTERY LIFEVery good. I was able to keep playing for 6 hours and still it has power. I did not let it run very low. USB charging makes it very convenient to charge this.Overall I am very impressed and I highly recommend it!

Check my video review for review of phone, some apps and GPS capability at the end. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone.  It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 2 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them. Phones don't get obsoleted. The previous gen phones still make phone calls and take great pictures as they did on day 1. Both Galaxy Note 2 and 3 have Micro-SIM. I have played around with a Note 3 and using on a regular basis and it is gorgeous phone in itself. The following paragraph applies to buying unlocked phones..DISPLAY: Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen.Note 3 has 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm (5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in) and weight 168 g (5.93 oz).Note 2 has Dimensions 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4 mm (5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37 in) and Weight: 183 g (6.46 oz).Note that it has become slightly less taller and 15 gm lighter! This is great as weight is a very important factor in handholding and for long uses. Both the phones have excellent S Pen stylus.Note 3 has 1920 x 1080 pixels, 5.7 inches (~386 ppi pixel density).Note 2 is 1280x720 pixels, 5.5 inches (~267 ppi pixel density). Note the superb increase in resolution. This is great as Note 3 has full HD finally. For comparison, Galaxy S4 has 5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display (441 ppi).MEMORY Both Note 3 and Note 2 has Card slot : microSD, up to 64 GB. Internal: 16/32/64 GB storage, Note 3 has 3 GB RAM whereas Note 2 has 2 GB RAM.WLAN: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, dual-band, DLNA (Both Note 2 and Note 3)Bluetooth: v4.0 with A2DP, LE, EDR (Both Note 2 and Note 3)NFC: Yes (both Note 2 and 3)USB: microUSB v3.0 (MHL 2), USB Host (Note 3, finally USB 3 on phones!)microUSB v2.0 (MHL), USB Host (Note 2)CAMERA:Note3: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels,autofocus, LED flash, Video 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps (Note 3, Note the substantially improved camera resolution)Note 2: Front: 8 MP, 3264x2448 pixels, video: 1080p@30fps, check quality; Back: 1.9 MPI feel for low light the camera did not perform well and this is an improvement I would like Samsung to make in low light sensors.Chipset:Note 3: Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 (LTE model)/ Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 (3G model) Note 3 has Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and if you see they have several technologies for different models.Note 2: Exynos 4412 Quad CPU: Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 GPU: Mali-400MPSensors: Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometerGPS: with A-GPS support and GLONASSBATTERY: Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery (note 2) 3200 mAh (note 3)SAR (radiation level is often not considered in many reviews and it is an important level of comparison).SAR:Note 3 US Model: 0.55 W/kg (head) 1.49 W/kg (body)Note 3: EU Model: 0.21 W/kg (head)Note 2 US Model: 0.23 W/kg (head) 0.95 W/kg (body)Note that SAR ratings have increased for Note III version.Galaxy Note III is an awesome phone for its use cases. It is a delight for note taking purposes. I have used Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, Galaxy Tab 2/3 and I really love the Galaxy series. I can see the high end smartphones really getting saturated. For users with Note II or S4, I will not recommend upgrading unless you always want the latest and the greatest. You still have a great phone and it is not outdated just because Note III has come out. Your camera takes just great pictures as it did last month. Just like Detroit/Japan rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades. If you have a different phone or a low end phone or you are from that iSomething world, welcome to Galaxy series!Battery life is good.  The video playback was crisp. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs. I am not that annoyed with the Samsungware as I really like S-Health and some other apps. Mainly note taking apps are awesone.  People of course can root and put Cyanogenmod at some point later.I used to put a 64 GB microSDXC card SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging for video/song/ebooks.  I have since upgraded to 128 GB MicroSD and it works great! No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are: AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.Note III infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. Games were very buttery. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). Smooth and Stunning display! NFC works awesome. I use a Qi charger with a Qi wireless receiver and they work great as well.Some Extra Accessories:NFC has lot of use cases. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAldiko Premium and Kindle Reading AppsAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoiceTemple Run series of gamesPlenty of WidgetsAPPENDIX: If you are comparing multiple phones, here is the quick highlevel breakdown of top phones as of mid 2014.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size, weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance.  External storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don't advertise or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy Note III. I will be glad to answer any questions.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Awesome phone and form factor","unixReviewTime":1401494400,"reviewTime":"2014-05-31T00:00:00"}

I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available.Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery.  I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the &#8220;undisputed king of the Android smartphone space&#8221;. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products.If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5.  (please see my stats below).  In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious!

Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5&#8221; is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don&#8217;t use it as a primary phone.  The display in S5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it!ANDROID UI:S5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface hasa flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery, Qi charging receivers for wireless charging on Galaxy phones and they were in awe.WATER PROOF:Obviously I have not tested this!,  but a very nice to have feature and gives a peace of mindCAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. S5 has a 16MP camera with super-fast autofocus, HDR mode with real-time preview, and support for 4K video recording. Definitely state of the art.  I took several indoor photos and they look great. It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release.S-HEALTH:I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5. It has driven my fitness regimen to a very good progress and the design of app is nothing short of buttery and beautiful. I am often too in good favor of Samsung loading the phones with S-Ware, but their design of S-Health is definitely breathtaking. Heart rate monitor is a great addition to the fitness tools. I used it for walking several steps and found it same as in S4.PROCESSING POWER:Don&#8217;t bother about it.  For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:I wonder why Samsung does not release wireless charging built in. You have to get a external Qi wireless charger and open the back, align it and use with a Qi charger. It should be integrated, but you can do it after the fact.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch (  I mean  around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when  I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both. I am programming my S5 also to do host of things.128 GB Micro SD card!!This is just incredible. If you see my reviews, I have been saying having external capacity is very key. With a 4K camcorder you can fill your space in a blink of the eye. Movies take up space. Who would have thought a 128 GB tiny card can fit in  a phone. This is just incredible. I tested with a 128 GB  and it works wonderfully! A 16 GB phone memory will have around 10 GB spare initially.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews.  On the GO USB cable + S5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don&#8217;t necessarily have to open  a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don&#8217;t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:I tested fingerprint scanner, but I am not sure how reliable it will be over time with scratches/oily fingers etc. I have to test it further, but for now I will settle on traditional passwords till bugs are ironed out.  Apple&#8217;s initial fingerprint software had bugs which was fixed subsequently. There are so many other features in S5. Some of them have become so standard that they are not review worthy!  e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up).To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they hve for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5. I will be glad to answer any questions within 24 hours.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Evolutionary NOT revolutionary!","unixReviewTime":1397174400,"reviewTime":"2014-04-11T00:00:00"}

Samsung's fourth generation of Galaxy Tab series is as expected and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and 3 and I am very much impressed with Galaxy line of devices. I got to play with all of the three Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 series for few days. I like them that I am getting all three and selling last year&#8217;s model. First, if you have not had any tablets before, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 7&#34;. It is ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7&#34; Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7&#34; form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8&#34;. In my opinion 8&#34; is the maximum value for the money and features, but 7&#8221; has the best pixel density of all three Galaxy 4 series.  If you are just starting out 7&#8221; is great and prices will FALL further as year progresses.Samsung has introduced 7&#34;, 8&#34; and 10.1&#34; of the Tab 4 series. This year the space has become crowded as Samsung also has 8.4&#8221;, 10.1&#8221; and 12.2&#8221; Tab Pro Series. They are pricier, but if you can afford I very STRONGLY suggest you get the PRO series just for one thing - RESOLUTION. I was really hoping the Tab series will go to a higher resolution.

I will later compare with the previous Tab 3 models. I have also listed brief specs of current leading tablets at the very end if you would like to really compare and shop.

I was only able to charge my iPad to 61% of its full charge, but considering iPad's size this is still really impressive, and on par with all the other batteries of this capacity.To fully charge this battery it takes about four to five hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering. The best way to charge this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight. You can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone USB charger.This New Trent battery is beautifully designed and very compact. It's also fairly light, and overall very convenient and portable. It is probably the smallest and lightest external battery of this capacity that I've come across.The battery aslo includes a small LED and Laser lights. These can be turned on and off using just one power button that turns on the battery. This is a very efficient and ingenious design, but took me a bit to figure out all the various powering options. Laser makes this battery double as a presentation pointer, which is a very useful feature to have if presentations are a part of your work description.One issue that I have with this battery is that by relying on USB port for its charging you lose the convenience of being able to charge it by just plugging it into the wall power outlet. With the ubiquity of USB devices and stand-alone USB power supplies, this is much less of an issue than it would have been just a few years ago. I am perfectly happy with this method of charging, but if you anticipate having to primarily rely on power outlets in your personal or professional life, then you might want to reconsider getting this battery.Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with this battery charger.

Screens, however, tend to be exceedingly hard to apply, and this one from Amazon is no exception. However, Amazon has gone the farthest as far as helping users apply the screen to their device with a few small improvements. The most significant of those are the two \"masks\" that are attached to the back and front of these protective films - one to be removed before the application, and one after. They help prevent accidental smudges on the film during the application process. The application process, however, is still exceedingly frustrating. It is very hard to align the protective film with the device screen, and even the smallest speck of dust that gets caught between the film and the screen can create air bubbles that give the whole screen and unappealing appearance. Once you get it applied though, the screen is as functional and effective as they come. The film feels good to the touch and has significantly reduced glare. My only objection is that the whole around the home button on the front could have been a tad bit larger.This product comes in Amazon's \"frustration free\" packaging, which was indeed very easy to open, albeit not exactly frustration-free. The cardboard that the packaging was made out was flimsy and that tab that needed to be ripped in order to open the package sort of broke of.

Nowhere is this more visible than in the realm of GPS car navigation. The sensitivity and functionality of the best smartphones are on par with, or even exceed in some respects, dedicated GPS navigators.One of the main obstacles to even the wider adoption of smartphones as navigation devices is the extra investment that one has to make for dedicated software and a mount. Furthermore, most smartphones have very weak external speakers. Some of the recent car models are Bluetooth enabled and you can stream smartphone's sound through the car speakers. However, this option can be sometimes buggy and difficult to set up.This iPhone 4 car mount from Kensington provides a convenient and easy way of amplifying the sound from your phone. The mount uses passive sound amplification. This means that it doesn't use any electronic means of amplifying the audio signal, but it relies instead on the carefully designed acoustics of the case to achieve the amplification. At first I was skeptical of the claim that the sound volume will be doubled, but my skepticism was quickly laid to rest when I tried it out. The sound was definitely noticeably louder with the iPhone in the mount than without it. Whether it's exactly twice the original volume I am unable to determine, but that sounds very plausible to me.The mount feels a bit cheap in quality, but otherwise it is pretty sturdy. The arm of the mount is fairly long. This may be useful for a better view of the iPhone while you are driving, as well as for the better sound volume. If your windshield is not far from the driving wheel then at first you may find the iPhone to be too close to your face. The suction cup is very effective, and will not use suction for months at the time (I have actually tried this). The flexible arms of the holder allow you to use the iPhone with or without the additional bumper or the case. You can also put other iPhones, smartphones, or even stand-alone GPS navigators into the cup - it is truly versatile. However, the sound amplification will not work with most of these other devices. There is also a vent mount in this package that allows you to position the iPhone on one of the AC vents.Overall, this is a very good product that delivers on its basic premise. If you are considering using your iPhone 4 as a GPS navigation device then I would definitely recommend this mount as a good option.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Very Good iPhone 4 Car Mount","unixReviewTime":1312070400,"reviewTime":"2011-07-31T00:00:00"}

However, I was a bit skeptical about the usefulness of such a tripod for an iPhone, but after playing with it for a while I have really started liking it.Two main functions of a camera tripod are: a) steadying the camera for crisper shots, and b) using it for time-delayed shots of yourself. iPhone 4 has a pretty neat camera, but if you really want to get a nice shot you might as well get a dedicated digital camera. Furthermore, it turns out that the default iPhone camera app does not support time-delay. This is rather odd, as this would be a very simple software feature to implement. There are a few iPhone apps that allow for both time-delay and time-lapse photography, and these apps might be a more suitable choice for the iPhone + tripod setup. Nonetheless, there are few other uses for this tripod with your iPhone that traditional camera have not been designed for.As mentioned before, iPhone is not really meant to be used like a \"real\" camera, so there is no direct way of attaching a tripod to it. The solution that the Joby tripod came up is very ingenious: this tripod comes attaches to an iPhone 4 bumper that is included in this package. If you don't own an iPhone 4 bumper but wanted to get one, then this solution may seem ideal for you. However, if you either own and like your bumper, or are not interested in adding bulk to your shiny and elegant iPhone 4, then this \"feature\" may annoy you.The bumper itself is OK. It is not as bulky as some other iPhone bumpers/cases that I have seen, but it's not the flimsiest one either. The make of the bumper does not exude elegance, and it feels a bit cheap. However, it is fairly sturdy and has all the requisite functionality that you would expect from it. A couple of issues that I have with bumper's thickness are: a) mute switch is not easily accessible, and b) if you use this bumper then you will not be able to connect your iPhone to the designated alarm clock such asPhilips DC290/37 Docking Clock RadioorMemorex Mi4390BLK Clock Radio.The bumper allows for your iPhone to be attached in either the landscape or the portrait orientation. The former is more convenient for photography or video viewing, while the latter works best for FaceTime video calling. The flexible legs of the tripod are very sturdy, yet extremely flexible. You can either set your iPhone in a traditional horizontal tripod configuration, or attach it to a countless variety of sticking, protruding or hanging objects. The possibilities are literally innumerable.Thanks to the little camera adapter kit you can use this tripod with your regular point-and-shoot compact camera. For me at least this is the best use for this tripod. The weight limit of a camera that can be put on this tripod is 325 grams, which I think is well within the limits of most compact cameras. I have tested it with bothCanon PowerShot S410(200 grams) andCanon PowerShot SD940IS(120 grams). It worked perfectly with both of them. I also tried it with myCanon Digital Rebel XSiDSLR camera (550 grams), and it even sort of worked with it as well, but I would certainly not recommend it to be used this way. If you suddenly come across Elvis in some remote outpost and there is absolutely no other way of taking a picture of the two of you together, then sure, you may use this tripod with your SLR behemoth. Anything short of that would unnecessarily endanger your camera.In conclusion, if you don't have too demanding requirements of how you end up using this tripod with your iPhone, or have a very specific idea in mind about what you want to use it for, then this tripod will serve you well. The same holds if you intend to use it with your compact digital camera - it makes an excellent and versatile stand. However, as an iPhone 4 tripod it has several shortcomings. These are not serious enough to prevent you from using it in a manner that it was intended, but this is certainly not a tripod that will serve everyone's needs. I am personally very happy with it and intend to use it quite a bit.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Cool and Versatile Tripod for your iPhone 4","unixReviewTime":1296518400,"reviewTime":"2011-02-01T00:00:00"}

So in the end I cannot but resort to using screen protectors and cases.Here is my breakdown of various aspects of this Generiks screen protector.Application - 4 stars. All these screens are relatively hard to install, and I have never managed to get the job done right on the first try.Protection - 4.5 stars. The screen seems pretty scratch thick. However, it will acquire its own share of scratches. You will probably need replacing it after several months of use.Anti-glare - 4 stars. The screen manages to substantially reduce the glare in broad daylight, but it doesn't completely eliminate it.Screen vibrancy - 3.5 stars. Having this screen protector on your iPhone 5 or 5S will definitely diminish a lot of the beauty and color vibrancy of that display.Anti-fingerprint - 3 stars. The screen protector still attracts a fair share of fingerprints. It's better than the iPhone's screen in its own right , but not by much.Price - 5 stars. It's really hard to beat $5 for three screen protectors, which is the price for which this pack sells for right now on Amazon.Overall impression - 4 stars. It's a decent, inexpensive screen protector, but not the best one you could get for your iPhone 5/5S.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Decent Screen Protector","unixReviewTime":1385164800,"reviewTime":"2013-11-23T00:00:00"}

Over the years I've used many corded and cordless headphones, and all of them come with their own sets of pros and cons. As far as I am concerned, these Jabra Sport headphones are the best corded sports headphones that I've come across.Putting the headphones around your ears is a bit tricky, but once they are there they stay firmly in place. These headphones don't fit as tightly as some of the around-the-head wireless headphones that I have used (such asMOTOROKR S9), but they are much more comfortable. I've tried using them while running and they are did not fall out, something that regularly happens with my iPhone headphones.The sound quality of these headphones is OK. It's on par, or maybe slightly better, than the standard earphones that come with iPod and iPhone. It can't, however, compete with higher end in-ear headphones, especially those that provide some kind of noise cancellation. However, I've found that noise-canceling headphones are actually really weird to use with phone calls, so if the sound quality is not high on your priority list or if you want to have headphones that work well with phone calls, then these sport headphones might be for you.Overall I am fairly happy with the telephony features of these headphones. I've tried them with iPhone and Skype, and in both cases they performed well. The call quality was as good as they come. The headphones dropped out of the music player and picked up phone signal on my iPhone with no discernable glitches. This feature is often advertised with these kinds of headphones, but it doesn't always work smoothly.The headphone cords are well made and thanks to couple addition long enough to accommodate placement of the mp3 player almost anywhere on your body. There is a small plastic clip on the cord that allows you to fasten it to your clothing. This comes in handy when you are working out as it prevents the cord from getting entangled with your workout equipment. There is a volume slider on the cord as well, but unfortunately there are no buttons for skipping tracks. The cord is thin and flat (think linguini as opposed to spaghetti) and this helps prevent entanglements.I have not used these headphones long enough to know how sweat, rain and dust they are resistant. In my experience sweat is the biggest enemy of all exercise-aimed headphones, and have not come across any that don't eventually break down. The Jabra headphones seem well rubberized with hardly any buttons that could come in touch with sweat, so I am willing to give them a benefit of a doubt in this department.The headphones come with a small carrying case. If you regularly put your headphones in a gym bag or any other rough environment, then you will appreciate having them protected in such a case. The case also helps with the entangling problems. It is very easy to open and placing the headphones in it is straightforward and convenient.So far, I am satisfied with these headphones. If I discover anything else that warrants reporting I'll post it in this review in some future update.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Very Good Corded Sports Headphones","unixReviewTime":1314057600,"reviewTime":"2011-08-23T00:00:00"}

This one has worked fine over the past two months, so now I am increasing my rating to three stars. If it works fine for at least a year I'll bump it up to four stars again.***** Update to the Original Review: November 7th 2011 ****After just two weeks of use this headset started acting up. The indicator light turned purple, and for a while I was unable to completely turn it on. (For some reason the FM radio still worked fine). Eventually I get it to work and pair up with my iPhone again, but all controls seem to be out of whack and there is no consistent performance at all. I will try to contact the customer service about this, but for the time being I cannot recommend anyone to buy this headset and have lowered the rating to two stars.***** Original Review *****I have been a big fan of Bluetooth stereo headsets ever since the first ones appeared several years ago. At the time I had been pairing them with cell phones with mp3 players, which seem to be light years away from today's smartphones. The Bluetooth headsets are ideal for workouts: compact, unobtrusive, and very functional. I have gone through at least fiveMOTOROKR S9andMotoROKR S9-HDheadsets all of which shared one common major shortcoming: they were not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than a year of use. Because of this I have been considering completely swearing off Bluetooth headsets in the gym, but I decided to give these Jabra headphones a chance. My first impression is fairly positive, but for me the true acid test will be how well they deal with sweat over an extended period of time.I also already ownJabra SPORT corded Stereo Sports Headset, so I am able to compare the corded vs. cordless version of this product. Overall they are fairly similar, with the corded ones having a slightly better sound quality and the Bluetooth one having a better fit.**** Sound Quality ****Unfortunately the sound quality is one of the weaker aspects of this headset. The sound is very tinny and hissy, especially with the high notes. I am not exactly an audiophile, but I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality of this headset. It is passable (barely) for the workout use, but I would definitely not use these headphones to listen to the music on other occasions.**** Design ****Unlike the sound quality, I was very impressed with the design of this headset. It is fairly minimalistic with the \"functional\" area of the headset confined to the immediate vicinity of the ears, and with a very thin and unobtrusive cord that connects the two halves. I do wish that the cord had a different color (yellow is not exactly the epitome of coolness), but this is not a major issue. Thanks to the kind of design that these headphones utilize it is possible to fold them and put them in almost any pocket or a bag. I just wish that the headset came with a carrying case like its corded cousin.**** Fit ****Fit is another feature that left me pleasantly surprised. Most cordless mono headsets are fairly loose on your ear, so I was expecting something akin to that experience with what are essentially two mono headsets connected with a cable. The actual experience couldn't have been further from my expectation. These headphones accomplish an almost impossible task: they fit very snuggly without either pinching your ears or putting too much pressure on your head. It could be that the size and shape of my ears makes them particularly suitable for this headset, but my guess is that most people would find them a fairly good fit.**** Wireless Range ****This is one of the weakest characteristics of all Bluetooth sport stereo headsets. The range is fairly good - if you are indoors and/or have a direct line of sight with the headset. I've been able to use them under such conditions across a decent sized room. However, if you are outdoors and put your mp3 player in pants pocket opposite to the side of your antenna (that would be the right hand side), then your reception will be intermittent at best. I usually use this headset in the gym, so this is not so much of an issue for me, but when I go out I try to put the mp3 player in a shirt or jacket pocket. That usually works just fine.**** Telephony ****I've used them to make several phone calls, across the regular phone lines and via VOIP, and in all situations this headset performed quite well. If you are listening to music when you receive a phone call it will automatically switch to the phone.**** FM Radio ****This is a really neat and unique feature of these headphones, and I have gotten to use it quite a bit. The reception is fairly good, especially if you are outdoors. If you want to go for a run or a walk and don't necessarily want to bring your mp3 player/smartphone along, then this feature will allow you to still enjoy some music. However, you will be unable to manually choose your radio station without the headset going through all of the available ones first.**** Audio Prompts ****Unlike the other Bluetooth headsets that I've used, this headset gives you voice prompts when you do all major function changes, such as turning it on/off, or switching between phone and mp3 player. This is very useful because you will be able to clearly know when any one of these events takes place.**** Battery Life ****I've been able to use these headphones for well over three hours, mostly listening to music but also making a brief phone call. This again is on par with other wireless headphones that I've used. Before the battery runs out you will hear repeated warnings of \"low battery\". At first I appreciated being told what is going on better than if I had to deal with an annoying beeping sounds, but after a while the incessant repetition (that only got more frequent as the battery kept losing its charge) really got to me. In a way this might be a good thing if you are procrastinating about charging the headphones, but if you just want to use them for as long as possible before you have to recharge then you'll definitely feel annoyed. On my iPhone I also get a small headphones power level icon next to the Bluetooth icon, and this helps you gauge how much battery power you have left. If you go to the gym three times a week for an hour or so, then you can get away with charging these headphones once a week. For a more frequent gym attendee, or for someone who uses these headphones for some other daily routine, then I would recommend charging them more or less each day.**** The Charger ****This is one of the most frustrating and disappointing features of these headphones. The headphones are charged using a micro-USB cord, but the charger's cord is extremely short (about five inches). This means that unless you have a power strip on your desk you will need to charge the headphones by essentially putting them on the ground. Fortunately I've discovered that Kindle's charger also works with these headphones, so I've been using that one instead.**** The Packaging ****These headphones come in a cool and sophisticated looking oval package. The package resembles a can more than a box, and conveys a very modern and dynamic look. However, the packaging is was not very intuitive to open, but once I figured it out it was extremely easy to do.**** For iPhone 4S Users ****I've managed to launch Siri directly from this headset by pressing and holding the play button slightly longer than fro the play function, but not as long as for the on/off function. This is a neat feature that will let you use Siri even when your iPhone is slightly out of reach.**** Conclusion ****Overall, I am fairly pleased with this headset despite its few serious shortcomings. I hope that the headset is truly sweat-proof, and that the future versions will address some of the above issues.","overall":3.0,"summary":"Updated Review - Rating Demoted from 4 Stars","unixReviewTime":1320105600,"reviewTime":"2011-11-01T00:00:00"}

It has a very innovative design - it's essentially two cases, snuggly wrapped around each other. The \"inner\" case is a rubberized silicone sleeve that looks like a swimming bodysuit. It's very easy to put on your Galaxy S3 smartphone. The outer case is hard polycarbonate case that's a bit trickier to put, but otherwise very well built and it gives you the sense of sturdiness and protection. This dual layer approach to smartphone casing is meant to give an increased impact-resistance, and a much more protective case than most single-layer cases. If you are clumsy with your smartphone, then you should definitely check out this particular case.The case is fingerprint-proof and scratch-resistant, and it has all the appropriate openings for the headphones, camera, and the charging dock. The volume control is covered with the rubbery case, and it somewhat diminishes the sensitivity of those buttons. The texture of the case feels really good in your hand and it provides you with a solid and comfortable grip.Overall, this is a very nice looking and well-designed product that will give your Galaxy S3 smartphone additional protection, and provide you with a peace of mind while using it in all sorts of situations.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Sturdy and Elegant","unixReviewTime":1342224000,"reviewTime":"2012-07-14T00:00:00"}

It has met or exceeded most of my expectations for such a device. I would strongly recommend it as a travel backup battery for most small electronic devices, tablet and netbook computers.***** The Specs *****This 10,000 mAh battery has one DC 5V 1A input, two USB outputs, and one output for a variety of power outlets. The output voltage can be set on either 9V or 12V, although you can also charge devices that take 5V. One of the USB outputs is designed with the iPad in mind, while the other one is intended for Samsung Galaxy S tablet. The specified input charging time is 6-7 hours, and in my own test I've verified this to be an accurate estimate. The total number of rechargings is specified to be 500, but for obvious reasons I've not been able to test this claim.***** Battery Capacity *****At 10,000 mAh, Astro3 is the largest-capacity external battery that I've ever tested. It has enough capacity to charge an iPhone or any similar small electronic device at least a three times. For a less power-hungry device (plain vanilla cell phone, Kindle, etc.) you can expect to get many full charges from this battery. The two USB charging outputs have different charging rates, but either one will be able to charge your device in a two to three hours max. I have tested the charger with Morolar Razr, Motoroal Krzr, Amazon's third and fourth generation Kindle, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4S, and the first generation iPad. It performed more than adequately with all of those devices.In order to get a good, intuitive feel for the charge capacity of this external battery I subjected it to the \"iPad test.\" That is, I try charging my first generation iPad form the fully discharged state in order to see how much \"juice\" am I able to get. iPad is the largest electronic device that I can think of that would still qualify (barely) into the small-electronics category. The verdict: I was able to fully charge my iPad without completely depleting the battery. This is the first such battery that I've tested that has passed this test. It took this battery about two hours to charge it to this level. This means that you'll be able to watch several movies on a trans-oceanic flight and still be able to use your iPad when you land.***** Accessories *****The battery comes with a built-in power adapter, two USB cords, and about twenty or so different tips for various small electronic devices. This versatility of adapter heads means that you'll be able to use this battery with most cellphones and small electronic devices that are popular right now, including all of the Apple's iOS devices. I wish that the battery came with a small carrying bag or a pouch to put all these accessories in, as I find myself losing these kinds of accessories more often than I care to admit.***** Design and Build *****The battery sports a slick cool design, and it looks and feels very modern. It doesn't feel cheep, and it will definitely not look out of place with the latest and coolest electronic gizmos. It's fairly heavy, so I'd not recommend carrying it in your pocket, purse or even an iPad case.***** The Bottom Line *****If you are a frequent traveler and carry more than one small electronic device with you all the time, or tend to go on longer trips to places without an easy access to a wall outlet (camping, long flights) then this charger is a must for you. It will keep all of your devices charged for a reasonably long periods of time, and it will give you a peace of mind that you'll never be in a situation where you run out of power. Astro 3 battery is compact and durable, and it will serve well all of your portable charging needs. On the other hand if you don't need to carry too many devices, or your devices are on the small side, then I'd recommend that you check out eitherAnker Astro,Anker Astro2or theIncredicharge I-5000battery.

Even though at the device end of the charging cable there are still many existing standards, the USB plug seems to justify the U in its name - it is becoming pretty near universal. However, the sheer number of such devices that I travel with - iPhone, iPad, Kindle, headphones, et.c - still means that I usually have to remember to take with me at least three or four chargers if I am to be able to charge all of my gadgets simultaneously. This is why I am always excited to come across a solution that can simplify my digital life and make it more tractable. This wall charger is definitely one such device.This charger enables you to simultaneously charge up to four different devices. Two of its USB ports carry 2 A currents, while the other two carry 1A currents. This effectively means that you can simultaneously charge two different tablets and two different smartphones. I've used this charger several times already, and was indeed able to charge four devices simultaneously. The charger is pretty solidly built, and it seems pretty reliable.I do have one issues with this charger though: The wall prongs are not foldable/retractable.

I was only able to charge my iPad to 55% of its full charge, but considering iPad's size this is still really impressive.To fully charge this battery it takes about six hours.

The seven different charging connectors are very small and they don't connect too securely to the USB cable. Being so small may make them prone to getting lost. I think that equipping the charger with its own \"drawer\" where the connectors would be kept would be useful, although that would certainly add to the bulk of the battery itself and make it less portable. I've discovered that using your own dedicated USB charging cord (if available) is usually preferable to fiddling with the attachments.The bigger issue is that by relying on USB ports for charging you lose the convenience being able to charge it by just plugging in into the wall power outlet. With the ubiquity of USB devices and stand-alone USB power supplies, this is much less of an issue than it would have been just a few years ago. I am perfectly happy with this method of charging, but if you anticipate having to primarily rely on power outlets in your personal or professional life, then you might want to reconsider getting this battery.Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with this battery supply.

Even though at the device end of the charging cable there are still many existing standards, the USB plug seems to justify the U in its name &#8211; it is becoming pretty near universal. However, the sheer number of such devices that I travel with &#8211; iPhone, iPad, Kindle, headphones, et.c &#8211; still means that I usually have to remember to take with me at least three or four chargers if I am to be able to charge all of my gadgets simultaneously. This is why I am always excited to come across a solution that can simplify my digital life and make it more tractable. This wall charger is definitely one such device.This iXCC charger enables you to simultaneously charge up to four different devices. Two of the USB outlets supply 2 A of current, while the other two work with 1 A. This means that this charger is ideal for charging two tablet-sized devices with two smartphones at the same time. I&#8217;ve used this charger several times already, and was indeed able to charge four devices simultaneously. The charger is pretty solidly built, and it seems pretty reliable.There are a few issues that I have with this charger. First of all, I wish that all four USB outlets supplied 2 A current. That would make simultaneous charging of four different devices much faster. Second, instead of the power chord I wish that the charger used retractable power prongs and was able to be directly plugged into the wall outlet. That would make it much more portable and reduce the overall clutter.There are also some external batteries that are about the size of this charger that can serve dual purpose: charging your devices when plugged in the wall AND while you are away from any wall outlets. If you anticipate needing to recharge your devices on-the-go, those external batteries might be a better solution for your needs.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Pretty Good Wall Charger","unixReviewTime":1392249600,"reviewTime":"2014-02-13T00:00:00"}

This was strictly for app and accessory development - I still use iPhone as my primary phone. After fiddling with several phones I finally settled on Samsung Galaxy SIII as my choice - it had the best price/feature set of all the phones that I've either tested or considered. However, it still has a fair share of shortcomings (and I'll probably write about those in another review). One of the more noticeable shortcomings was its unacceptably short battery life. Even on the full standby mode the battery would die after only little over a day of use. And this is without me even setting up the cell phone coverage! So when an opportunity presented itself to check out a bigger capacity battery I immediately decided to seize the opportunity.So far I have been really impressed with this ZeroLemon extended battery. It has about three times the capacity of the standard S III battery, and my rough estimate of its life on a single charge is that it's about two to three times longer than what you normally get. The estimate is only rough since the usage and circumstances may vary from day to day and from an individual to individual. In terms of battery capacity I am definitely impresses with this product.This extended battery attaches to your cell phone by removing the back cover and the standard battery. The ZeroLemon battery is too physically large to fit inside the regular cover, and hence the back of your phone needs to be covered with the included TPU cover. This is an effective, albeit not very elegant solution. The new cover dramatically alters the look and feel of your phone. Also, even though I have not had any problems with it so far, the cover doesn't feel as securely and snugly in place as a snap-on cover that fits in the back. I've seen some other products out there that completely place the extended battery inside of an external cover, which to me seems like a sturdier solution.The cover leaves all of your main ports accessible, but it covers the side buttons with its own version of the same. These are effective, but not as responsive as the \"bare\" buttons on the phone itself.The extended battery also makes your phone noticeably thicker and heavier. However, if neither the extra bulk nor the esthetical look of your phone are not a concern for you, and you really need all the extra power that you can get, then this battery/cover combo will do the trick. I am still not sure how well it performs in the long run, but when I find out I'll try to post an update to this review.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Solid, Capacious Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S III","unixReviewTime":1376265600,"reviewTime":"2013-08-12T00:00:00"}

Over the years I had used that adapter very infrequently. Most of my computer monitors either use the VGA cable to connect to the permanently attached computer, or, especially these days, don't use the VGA for input. Another inconvenience with the VGA adapter is that it doesn't carry audio, so a separate audio cable needs to be connected to the audio jack of the iPhone or iPad. Furthermore, the VGA resolution is pretty low, and most TVs these days either don't have a separate VGA plug or that mode is underutilizing the full potential of their resolution. The bottom line is this: the VGA adapters are largely useless for most purposes that I would need them for.This HDMI adapter is everything that I would want from such a device/cable. It connects my iPhone and iPad to the high-res TVs effortlessly, and provides the high resolution output that I have come to expect these days. My first generation iPad was recognized by my 24\" Westinghouse HDTV as a 720p input, and my iPhone 4S was recognized as 1080p input. I streamed several YouTube videos at various resolutions, and the output through this cable broadly corresponded to what I'd expect. I've watched whole episodes of Netflix-streaming shows, and have had no problems or delays with the picture quality. I was also able to mirror various iPhone apps onto the TV while using them. One of my favorite things to do with this adapter was to watch various videos and pictures that I had recorded onto my iPhone. Previously I had to settle to watching them only on the small screen.One of the most innovative features of this adapter is the ability to simultaneously charge your iOS device while watching the videos on your TV. In my previous experience streaming video content to the outside screen would usually result in a very rapid draining of the internal battery. With this adapter not only does this not occur, but I actually end up with extra battery power in my iPhone.There have, however, been some shortcomings and hiccups with the use of this adapter. Almost all of them were caused by the restrictions in either the iOS or the particular app that I was using. I was not able to play a movie that I downloaded into my iPad's movies collection due to some silly copyright rights management issues. While watching a Netflix move I was not able to pause it without disconnecting my iPhone first. There were some other minor glitches while watching the YouTube videos.As you might have guessed from this adapter's description and ints picture, this adapter is not designed to work with the latest generation of iOS devices. I hope that the future edition of this product incorporates those changes. I would also like to see the future version of this adopter use the mini HDMI output instead of the standard HDMI. Both of these changes would make such an adapter considerably more compact.Overall, this is a great product and its' definitely worth the money. You'll make the most out of your iOS devices with it.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Wonderful Product","unixReviewTime":1373414400,"reviewTime":"2013-07-10T00:00:00"}

However, there are a few things that I've noticed that you might want to consider. iPhone is a fairly light device, and that probably helps with preventing the cup from detaching. Also, I have not had the best experience with attaching this holder to anything but smooth, clean glass surfaces. It also probably helps that I am using it during the mild California winter - in my experience with other suction cups and windshield mounts they tend to come off in summer or really cold winter weather.The smartphone holding area is very versatile and can hold most smartphones that are available today. I would not try it with Galaxy Note or an even larger device, but short of that it should work well for most smartphones.The range of positions that you can put your smartphone in is one of this mount's greatest features. You can practically adjust it for almost any viewing angle, and it's relatively easy to adjust these angles while you are driving.The biggest shortcoming of this mount is its extension. It is a very small mount, and it will keep your smartphone very close to the windshield. This is problematic for two reasons. First, the visibility of the smaller smartphone screens will be diminished to the point of being useless. This could potentially be a safety hazard. Second, it may not be possible to extend the charging cord all the way to the smartphone from the cigarette lighter plug. This could prove particularly problematic during the longer drives.If you are looking for an easy and convenient \"backup\" smartphone mount, then this little guy might be just what you would want to get.

Oftentimes I was able to fully charge two or three devices with just one Incredi Cahrge fully charged battery. I was also able to charge two devices simultaneously.To fully charge this battery it takes about six hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering. The best way to charge this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight. You can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone USB charger.Incredicharge battery is very well designed and very compact.

If you spend a lot of time traveling, especially via a plane, and you tend to carry a lot of gadgets with you, then I would recommend you look into getting at least a 10,000 mAh external battery. For everything in between you can select the battery size closest to your needs and the kind of gadgets you carry around. I would not recommend going below a 5,000 mAh battery though. The smaller batteries will probably not be sufficiently big for a full recharge if you don't remember to charge them up regularly.This is a very nice, effective, and compact battery. It is slightly larger than iPhone 5/5S and similar to it in its overall shape. It can be easily carried around in a small messenger bag, briefcase, or a purse.

The battery has two charging ports and comes with a micro USB cable. It also features a small micro USB to 30-pin adapter, which comes in handy with the iOS devices. However, it doesn't seem like an Apple certified adapter, so it may or may not work with all of their devices.

As you would expect from such a device, it can hold a LOT of juice. I've tested it with several small and medium electronic devices, which I had previously completely depleted. I was able to fully charge first generation iPad, iPhone 4S and iPad Mini - all from a single charged PCastle and with plenty of leftover charge. I have not tested it with the latest generation iPad, but my guess would be that PCastel would be able to fully charge it once or twice.Unfortunately, I have not been able to use this power bank to charge a laptop, which is one of the main purposes that such a capacious external battery would be good for. I only have Mac laptops, and this battery doesn't come with the chords and connectors that will enable it to connect to a Mac. This is not just the problem with this battery - Apple is notorious for being very proprietary with their accessory connections, and I don't think there is an independent battery manufacturer out there with a product that will work with Macs. There are some hacks that will allow you to get around this restriction (you can buy an Apple power cord or appropriate one form your old charger), but all such tricks require certain level of familiarity with electronics and willingness to improvise.If you have any \"regular\" PC laptop, chances are that this battery pack will work with it. The battery supports several different voltage outputs (12V, 16V, and 19V) and comes with a gazillion adapters that can fit pretty much any laptop power input that I've come across.This is a beautifully made external battery. Its metal casing is stylish, elegant and very sturdy. It is, as you would expect it, fairly large and heavy. It weighs 662 grams or almost a pound and a half. This may not be an ideal emergency battery that you carry with you everywhere in your messenger bag, but it is a great backup resource to have if you find yourself on a long business trip or vacation.

In my opinion there is absolutely no other way to unobtrusively listen to the music while you exercise. However, all the headsets that I've used so far have one major problem: they all fail due to the moisture within a very short period of time. So this is one of the main reasons why I was excited to try out the DinoTwin headphones in the first place: their unique charging cable promises to remove one of the main sources of failure for the sports headphones: the charging jack. Only time will tell if this feature is indeed effective at this task, but so far I have been very positively impressed with these headphones.The sound quality of these headphones is one of their main attractions. First of all no wireless headphones of this size will ever be able to deliver the deep, clear sound that you expect form some of the higher end headphones, but these headphones sound richer and more vibrant than almost all the headphones I've tried before. They were on par or better than the Motorola S line of Bluetooth sports headphones, and miles better than the Jabra headphones.These headphones seem to feature passive noise canceling technology. They are pretty good at minimizing the outside sound while in use, and even when they are turned off. Several times I was in a situation where someone tried to talk to me while I was wearing them, and I had to take them off in order to hear what the person had to say.These headphones are probably the most reductionist ones that I've seen. They are just made out of two oversized earbuds and a connecting cord between them. This, IMHO, is the ideal form factor for the sports headphones. The earbuds are pretty large and stay firmly in my ears even during the moderately fast runs. The connecting cord loops around the ears, which gives the headphones extra stability. I've used them while running for several weeks and they stay firmly in the position. They score high on both the form factor and the comfort level.I have not used these headphones much for phone calls. In general I fund Bluetooth headsets to be quite inadequate for voice phone calling. The ones with solid noise cancelling (like these) are actually even worse for the purpose of phone calling - they don't provide the kind of audio feedback from your own voice that we are used to. The mic on these headphones also seemed below average, but then again, I was not going to use them for telephony anyways, so this aspect of the headphones neither bolsters nor diminishes a case for them.Even though these headphones paired easily with my iPhone, they did exhibit some issues. I was not able to turn them off while I was close to another Bluetooth device that my iPhone was paired with. I also found them to have a limited connectivity range, and the battery power, although adequate for two to three workouts, is a bit lower than some of the other headphones that I used in the past.I will be monitoring these headphones for the foreseeable future. If they manage to survive a year of use in the gym, and their battery power does not significantly diminish over that period of time, then they might be the best overall sports Bluetooth headphones that I have come across. However, until then a few issues that I came across mean that I cannot give them more than four stars out of five.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Really Good Sports Headphones","unixReviewTime":1373500800,"reviewTime":"2013-07-11T00:00:00"}

My old iPhone headphones were getting a bit worn out, and they were never really good headphones for gym use to begin with. The Aleratec headphones looked pretty hip and sporty, and seemed like the kind of headphones that I would enjoy using while working out. In that regard I have not been disappointed. The long, sturdy and rubberized tangle-free cables are capable of withstanding all the use and abuse of the gym workout. I can just stuff them into the pocket of my gym sweatshirt and be reassured that I would not have to waste any time untangling them when I&#8217;m ready to start my workout. The headphone gels fit securely and comfortably inside my ears. The extra long cable is great for the times when I am running on the treadmill and place my iPhone on the treadmill&#8217;s console.One of the most impressive things about these headphones is the sound quality. I usually don&#8217;t expect much from in-ear headphones, especially at this price range. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the richness and vibrancy of sound coming from these small headphones. I listened to various music genera on iTunes radio &#8211; classical, pop, electronic, etc., and these headphones were able to handle all of them quite well, to the point that I forget that I am wearing the headphones and just lose myself in music.There are a couple of things about these headphones that I didn&#8217;t quite like. I do miss the ability to control the volume and skip tracks directly on the headphones cable. Furthermore, when I used these headphones to make phone calls, people at the other end of the line were not able to hear me very clearly, although I was more than satisfied with the sound quality. This means I will probably go back to my iPhone headphones when it comes to placing phone calls.Overall, however, I am really happy with these headphones. I will continue to use them daily, which I think is the highest form of endorsement that I can come up with.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Compact, Comfortable, Great Sound","unixReviewTime":1384992000,"reviewTime":"2013-11-21T00:00:00"}

They seem an almost ideal way of listening to music or making the phone calls. The Bluetooth headsets are ideal for workouts: compact, unobtrusive, and very functional. I have gone through at least five MOTOROKR S9 and MotoROKR S9-HD headsets all of which shared one common major shortcoming: they were not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than a year of use. I also own four different Jabra Bluetooth headsets, and have become fairly familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of various models.In terms of functionality, my favorite Bluetooth headsets are still the stereo sport variety kinds. They are extremely compact and ideally suited for what I primarily use headphones for these days: listening to music while working out. However, most of them have (at least) two major shortcomings: lousy music quality and inability to withstand sweat over the prolonged use. This is why I have recently decided to give the &#34;pendant&#34; Bluetooth stereo headsets a try. So far I have been fairly impressed with this Jabra Play headset, albeit there are still a couple of shortcomings that I don't like.First of all, I am really impressed with the sound quality. It's not even remotely hissy or tinny like many other headsets that I had tried. If you are a die-hard audiophile then you will still find many shortcomings of these headphones, but for someone like me who just enjoys fairly clear and strong sound these headphones do the job.Pairing of these headphones was pretty straightforward, although you need to follow the instructions exactly - it's not enough for the headphones to be turned on in order for them to become &#34;discoverable.&#34;When I first started using these headphones it seemed that they would get completely discharged the first time I turned them off and tried using them again. This has happened a couple of times, but it must be a glitch since it has not happened to me again. I've been able to use them four to five times for a workout without recharging them, which is definitely much better battery life than most other headphones I've tried.The range of this headset seems to be on par with all other similar devices. I was able to listen to my iPhone across a larger room (gym) even with some obstacles in the way.My biggest issue with these headphones is their design. I don't like having the headphones receiver dangling in front of me, especially when I am working out. I've tried clipping it both to my t-shirt's sleeve and collar, but neither one of these locations is very conducive to working out either. Finally, I attached the receiver to my t-shirt behind my neck. This gets the job done, but it's also a very inaccessible location. I don't mind this all that much though, but the headphone cords tend to get tangled up very easily. This might be the most entangable cords I've come across.I have not used this headset for telephony. Overall I have not been impressed with Bluetooth headsets as phone receivers - they tend to be extremely choppy as receivers and I am still to come across a model for which this is not an issue. For phone calls I try to use the corded headsets as much as possible.This is a pretty good Bluetooth headset that is ideal for music listening in a wide variety of locations and situations.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Solid Bluetooth Headset","unixReviewTime":1377043200,"reviewTime":"2013-08-21T00:00:00"}

It also doesn't help that they all require different capacity chargers, depending on their size.This small dual wall USB charger is an ideal companion for a variety of charging situations. It is pretty small, and the charging pins fold into the body of the charger. This makes it ideally suitable for traveling purposes. You can also leave it permanently plugged in into an extra wall outlet at home and keep it there permanently.The charger is very well built and fairly attractive looking. This is not a cheap and unreliable charger, but a high quality product.A couple of issues that I have with this charger are the following:1. While fully extended the charger can potentially cover two charging spots. This is not that much of an issue if you plug it into the sole (or even a twin) wall power outlet, but if you are like me and tend to use an extension strip for powering of all of your devices, then the extra bulkiness can easily prevent you from using other power outlets on the strip. I would have preferred if this charger had two different charging pin configurations for different charging situations.2. The charging pins tend to be a bit loose when fully extended. This can prevent them from making a solid contact with the wall socket, and obstruct the proper functioning of this charger. A much firmer snap-in configuration would be more than desirable.Overall, this is a very neat and useful charger that is particularly suitable fro traveling purposes.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Nicely Designed and Useful","unixReviewTime":1373241600,"reviewTime":"2013-07-08T00:00:00"}

In some of the promotional pictures for this mount it seems like it can be mounted on the dashboard, but a closer look reveals that the mount is either attached to a smooth side surface or a specialty mat. I've been using a weighted dashboard mount for my other GPS unit for a while, and I was able to mount it that way. However, PortaGrip is way too heavy and bulky to stay in place and flips over too easily.Sticking the PortaGrip to the windshield is another story.

It's not quite as sticky as some other suction cups that I've tested, but it certainly gets the job done.PortaGrip is very sturdy, but it's also one of the bulkiest windshield mounts that I've come across.

I had supposed that it would just be another fancy charging accessory, which may improve the mess on my work desk, but would otherwise not have much additional use. However, it turns out that Android devices have a lot of additional functionality that lays hidden without access to proper peripherals.This dock is relatively well built and functional. It&#8217;s not made out of the most sophisticated and stylish materials out there, but it looks and feels sufficiently durable and stylistically adequate. It has a very workmanlike look and feel to it.When it comes to charging, the dock performs as well as one would have expected. It would have been really hard to mess up this aspect of the dock, so I am not surprised that it worked as advertised. You plug one end of your micro USB charging cable into the wall outlet power supply, and the other one into the dock itself, and you are all set. Charging will take as long as it does with the direct connection.Docking the phone is pretty straightforward. I am not the biggest fan of the micro USB connections, and this dock is no exception. Micro USB can be pretty finicky when it comes to aligning the male and female outlets. The docking area is pretty slim, and it&#8217;s hard, if not impossible, to dock your Galaxy device if it has a protective shell.Connecting my GS3 to TV via HDMI was really straightforward. The TV immediately recognized the HDMI input and displayed the smartphone&#8217;s screen. The GS3 screen was directly mirrored onto the TV, which did not look all that great as it only covered about the middle third of the TV&#8217;s visual real estate. Flipping the phone and the dock on their side too care of that, but this is far from technically elegant solution.The most effective way of using the smartphone while connected to TV is via an external Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackball/trackpad. USB keyboard/mouse are also supported, and they work about as well if not better, but they force you to be within the reach of your phone and have a stable flat surface on which to use them. There are intriguing possibilities of using your smartphone as a desktop replacement, but Android OS is far from adequate right now for that kind of use.The dock comes with two regular USB ports in addition to the micro USB port used for charging. The two ports can be used for above-mentioned USB mouse and keyboard, or they can be used for mounting USB drives. I&#8217;ve been able to mount two different flash USB drives simultaneously, and was able to access and manipulate files stored on them. This feature comes in really handy when watching large HD videos.The HD video playback on TV was excellent. The video looked crisp and was rendered without any glitches. The same goes for sound. Using this dock as an entertainment center device will however require that you have a proper Bluetooth controller. Either that or you&#8217;ll have to get off the couch every time you want to pause the video or rewind, which is such a 1950s way of watching TV.This is overall a pretty solid dock that performs all the functions it&#8217;s designed for more than adequately.

If you like to make a fashion statement with your consumer electronic devices, and if this kind of colorful design appeals to you, then Moonstone is a great charger to have.I've used the Moonstone 6000 charger for a few days, and overall I am pretty impressed with it. 6000 mAh of charge capacity is enough to charge my iPhone two or three times, and to fully charge my first generation iPad 3G. This is a very light and well designed charger that easily fits into a compartment pocket of your messenger bag or a suitcase. In an emergency it can even fit inside of a larger pocket. It comes with a micro USB cable, which can be used for charging of various Android smartphones, Kindle book readers, or any other device that uses micro USB charging cables. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with Apple's charging cables, so you will have to use your own or the ones bought from some other manufacturer. The micro USB cable can also be used to charge the Moonstone itself, but you will have to either rely on another charger or use your computer for this to work. Moonstone comes with a nice carrying bag, with pockets for both the battery and the cable.This is overall a pretty decent and nicely designed external battery, but it has its share of shortcomings compared to the other such chargers on the market right now. 6000 mAh is pretty much the low end of the capacity for such devices. Many of other external batteries come with Apple connector cables or attachments, as well as the ability to charge the battery independent of other devices. moonstone is also much more expensive than some of the other external batteries that I have tested.

The battery takes about four to five hours to fill up completely, and it charges my iPhone in about two hours.

It has a nice LED screen which lets you know the precise amount of power that is left (from 0 to 99%). Most power banks, if they bother with something like this, only give you the power remaining in quarter of a capacity increments. A more precise gauge can really come in handy when you are traveling.The other extra features I am much less enthused about. The power bank comes with a an LED light, a UV light, and a laser pointer. I have never reached for a power bank to be used as an LED flashlight, have no use for the UV light, and as a laser pointer this power bank is way too bulky. You might have different experiences/expectations, but as far as I am concerned these are not the strong selling points of this power bank.The two extra features that would actually be really useful in a device like this are: 1.

This is frustrating because it often means that Apple's products are not compatible with many other standard devices that are very readily available out there, but it;s also admirable because their products oftentimes exceed the quality and usability of the standard ones. The recent switch of the iOS devices to the Lightning input and cable is a case in point: it overnight made millions third-party gadgets and cables obsolete. It also made a big departure from Apple's own line of products. But it is by most measures a very good cable. For one, it's much easier to use than the micro USB connection - you don't have to squint every time at the connection when you are trying to connect your devices.The problem with Apple's cables, however, is that it's very hard for the third-party developers to get the license to manufacture them.

I think this would have been a much more effective product if it had two additions that some of its competitors already incorporate into their batteries/power banks: incorporated wall-outlet prongs for easy charging, and a permanently attached retractable micro USB cable. These two additions would make this battery stand out in the already very crowded field of external batteries/chargers.This GreatShield battery is also beautifully designed.

The choice will ultimately come down to your needs. If you spend most of your time near a wall outlet, then your standard wall charger will be all that you will almost ever need. If you spend a lot of time traveling, especially via a plane, and you tend to carry a lot of gadgets with you, then I would recommend you look into getting at least a 10,000 mAh external battery. For everything in between you can select the battery size closest to your needs and the kind of gadgets you carry around. I would not recommend going below a 5,000 mAh battery though. The smaller batteries will probably not be sufficiently big for a full recharge if you don't remember to charge them up regularly.This is a very nice, effective, and compact battery. It is slightly thinner than iPhone 5/5S and just a bit wider. It can be easily carried around in a small messenger bag, briefcase, or a purse. It can even fit in a pocket (hey, it is the size of a phone), but I would personally not recommend it.The battery doesn't come with its own charging adapter or cable, which is not such a big deal for me: I have plenty of micro USB cables laying around. The battery has two charging ports and a permanently attached charging micro USB cable. This feature makes this battery particularly suitable for those who use that kind of charging input. If you are an i-device user, however, you will have to reach for your own Apple USB cable.The charging time for this battery was pretty quick, as was the charging of external devices. I was able to fully charge my iPhone with plenty of room to spare. I was even able to charge my iPad to about 50% of its capacity. I also tried it with several other micro-USB charging devices (Galaxy S 3, Kindle, headphones, ...) and it worked fine with all of them, although I did not test them fully to ascertain the total charging time.Overall, I am very pleased with this battery and would recommend it to anyone who is in a need of small extra charging while on the go.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Small, Convenient, Effective","unixReviewTime":1381708800,"reviewTime":"2013-10-14T00:00:00"}

They seem an almost ideal way of listening to music or making the phone calls. The Bluetooth headsets are ideal for workouts: compact, unobtrusive, and very functional. I have gone through at least five MOTOROKR S9 and MotoROKR S9-HD headsets, four different Jabra Bluetooth headsets, and several headsets from smaller manufacturers, all of which shared one common major shortcoming: they were not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than a year of use.In terms of functionality, my favorite Bluetooth headsets are the stereo sport variety kinds. They are extremely compact and ideally suited for what I primarily use headphones for these days: listening to music while working out. This Brightech Active2 headset falls in that category. It is a decent headset with a few attractive features, but it still has a fair share of shortcomings. Here are some of my impressions:Pros:- Lightweight and compact. These are the most lightweight bluetooth stereo headphones that I've ever come across. While they are in my ears I can hardly notice that they are there.- Great price. You'll be hard pressed to find a better deal on stereo Bluetooth headphones anywhere. Sure, you can try getting some of the cheap knockoffs on eBay (and I had gone down that route before), but chances are none of those will really work. Or will work for about a week before they completely break down.- Decent sound. I really don't have very high expectations from the exercise headphones when it comes to the quality of sound. I just need the beat to be fairly strong and the music not to be &#34;muddy.&#34; These headphones satisfy on both accounts.- Easy pairing. I've paired them with my iPhone without any issues.- Quick charging. It took me a couple of hours to get them fully charged.Cons:- Short cord. The cord that connects the two headphones and keeps them together is very short. It is adjustable, but even at its longest extension it is just barely long enough to have these headphones wrap around my head.- Very loose fit. I tried wrapping them around my ears as shown in instructions, but even still they keep coming out constantly while I am running. They are slightly better for the types of exercise that don't require a lot of fast motion.- Very small and inconspicuous buttons. Those are really hard to reach and press properly, especially while exercising.- Cheap build quality. They don't imbue me with the sense of confidence that they will last a while. I've used them for a couple of weeks, and so far they've done well, but from my prior experience I know that this doesn't mean much in the long run. *Every* pair of bluetooth exercise headphones that I've ever tested has failed in the end. All of the manufacturers try to make theirs sweat-proof, but so far I've not come across one that was actually able to pull it off. The good news about these headphones in particular is that they are pretty inexpensive, so if they manage to last for at least a half a year, they would still be worth it in my opinion.- No battery level indicator. Most bluetooth headsets tell me on my iPhone how much battery charge there is left. This one starts beeping a few minutes before it runs out of power, but other than that it gives you no advanced warning.This could be a really great headset if they addressed some of these issues that I've pointed out. Even so, for the price you will probably not get a better bluetooth stereo sport headset.","overall":4.0,"summary":"3.5 Stars - They Work","unixReviewTime":1394064000,"reviewTime":"2014-03-06T00:00:00"}

The TrackR app was easy to locate in the App Store, and the initial setup was very smooth and clear. The app easily paired up with the device.

Unfortunately, smartphones and other portable music players were not exactly designed with the exacting gym environment in mind, and I always fumble to keep my iPhone close to me while avoiding sweat and all the heavy objects that could damage it. Even the small dedicated &#34;waterproof&#34; pockets in many of the shorts that I use are far from ideal. In my experience a dedicated armband or a pouch is the best option for keeping your smartphone safe and accessible while working out.This is probably the most sophisticated and durable sports armband that I've come across. The armband is thick and comfortable, and it grips your upper arm very securely. The smartphone pouch is very large, and can fit almost any smartphone on the market right now. I've tested it with Galaxy S3 and iPhone 4S. The iPhone that I have actually has a very thick case that doubles as a wallet, and I was still able to put it in. This is probably one of the nicest things about this Avantree armband - most armbands are designed with a single device in mind that can only fit in without the protective case. The smartphone case also houses an additional small pocket which can be used to keep a credit card/ID, some cash, keys, or the coiled up headphones when they are not in use. The protective screen is very well made, it's sweat-proof, and it allows you to still use the touchscreen of your phone. The bottom of the case has a small hidden opening that allows you to run the headphones cord through. In terms of its design, attention to details, and quality of materials this armband is second to none.Unfortunately, the fact that this armband is pretty large means that it is also quite bulky. This didn't bother me that much, and my running was not affected by it, but if you are of a slight build you might really notice the extra heft on your arm.I really like this armband and intend to use it as one of my primary gym accessory from now on.

The one touch spring-loaded phone attachment mechanism at first didn&#8217;t seem like such a big deal, but after using it for a while I think this is one of the biggest innovations with the dashboard/windshield smartphone mounts that I&#8217;ve come across. Attaching my phone or a stand-alone GPS device has always involved quite a bit of fiddling, but with this mount all of that is finally over.

It&#8217;s probably the strongest adhesive mounting that I have come across in any of the mounts I&#8217;ve tried over the years. The combination of a sticky surface and the strong suction lever ensure that this mount will remain firmly attached even during an extended period of use, and through many sharp accelerations and decelerations.The mounting attachment can rotate through 360 degrees in its plane, and it can also tilt through a decent range out of its plane. This allows for a very wide range of viewing angles. Unfortunately, changing the viewing angle cannot be accomplished with a simple one-handed action, but requires a little bit more of fiddling. I would definitely not recommend doing so while driving.I have tested this mount with iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, and Galaxy S3 phones. It worked really well with all of them.

This is a very light and well designed charger that easily fits into a compartment pocket of your messenger bag or a suitcase. In an emergency it can even fit inside of a larger pocket. It comes with a micro USB cable, which can be used for charging of various Android smartphones, Kindle book readers, or any other device that uses micro USB charging cables. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t come with Apple&#8217;s charging cables, so you will have to use your own or the ones bought from some other manufacturer. The micro USB cable can also be used to charge the AYL battery itself, but you will have to either rely on another charger or use your computer for this to work. AYL comes with a nice carrying bag, with pockets for both the battery and the cable.This is overall a pretty decent and nicely designed external battery, but it has its share of shortcomings compared to the other such chargers on the market right now. 6000 mAh is pretty much the low end of the capacity for such devices. Many of other external batteries come with Apple connector cables or attachments, as well as the ability to charge the battery independent of other devices. AYL, on the other hand, is very competitively priced, especially considering its more than decent quality. It is definitely a good product, but perhaps not the best one you can find right now. Ultimately, it will all depend on your needs: for light, occasional smartphone charging (especially is you don't own an iPhone) AYL will be more than adequate for most users.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Fun Small External Battery","unixReviewTime":1392422400,"reviewTime":"2014-02-15T00:00:00"}

The other end of the battery has a small LED flashlight. This form factor is actually ideally suited for such function, but unfortunately the lightbulb is not very bright.

They have managed to reduce the size of smartphones significantly, and they did away with a lot of complexity of physical design. The touch-screen keyboards also enable you to have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the various keyboard options - you can toggle between different languages and input styles with a simple press of a (touchscreen) button. However, they also have their limitations. The biggest one is the tactile feedback - being able to feel the keys as you type is a great aid in efficiency of typing, especially for all the touch-typists out there.The first generation of Galaxy S phones had a sliding physical keyboard, but all the subsequent S phones ditched it in favor of screen-only keyboards. This little OXA wireless keyboard enables all of the Galaxy S4 owners of getting a physical keyboard. The keyboard is well made, attaches easily to the S4, and it's fairly easy to use. It also doubles as a case for your phone. The bluetooth pairing was quick and straightforward. The keyboard has a nice enough key action, but I would have preferred a little bit more of tactile feedback - something along the lines of what Blackberry phones have.

I primarily use these headsets in the gym and/or while running. They are ideally suited for the situations where you don't want to have any cords dangling around your head. However, most of the ones I've used (even the top quality from renown brands) are sadly not waterproof, and all of them have a tendency to fail after few months of use. So I have reluctantly accepted the fact that as long as I insist on using the Bluetooth headsets in the gym, I will have to replace the headset on a somewhat regular basis. This is one of the main reasons why I have a strong preference for cheap headsets that just get the work done. In that regard this Senbowe headset is ideal for my purposes. Its quality, however, turned to be much higher than I had expected.**** Sound Quality ****I've come to expect that the Bluetooth headsets, especially the small ones, don't have the best sound quality. This is mostly OK for my purposes - using the headset to listen to the music while working out. However, this Senbowe headset has a surprisingly high quality of music. The sound is clear and crisp, and I actually enjoy listening to the music coming from this headset. It will, of course, not impress any die-hard audiophile, but for an inexpensive sports headset this is probably the best sound quality that you will come across.**** Comfort ****There are several earbud options that come with this headset, so they will probably fit into almost any ear. The fit is pretty comfortable, and the headset doesn't fall off while running. It is *extremely* lightweight, probably the lightest one I've come across, so much so that I could barely feel its presence.**** Piring up ****It took a bit of fiddling around, but I essentially had not problem pairing up this headset with my iPhone 4S.**** Cons/Issues ****I don't like the fact that this headset uses a somewhat nonstandard charging cable - a thin barrel one, instead of the more customary micro USB cable. The charging port is also exposed, which could be an issue with the prolonged use - sweat and water could get in there and damage it.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****","overall":4.0,"summary":"Surprisingly Impressive","unixReviewTime":1401753600,"reviewTime":"2014-06-03T00:00:00"}

It is not without its share of shortcomings, but overall I think it works pretty well for its intended purpose(s). Here are some of my quick observations.The 4000 mAh internal battery is a bit mediocre in terms of its capacity. It will allow you to fully charge your smartphone once, maybe twice. It will not be sufficient for to fully charge a tablet, except maybe some of the smaller ones. I think that this kind of device should boast at least a 6000 mAh internal battery to be a really worthwhile feature to have. However, it is still a pretty compact external battery, and if you are in the need of the extra features (voice recording and flashlight), then it could be a really good accessory to carry around for emergency purposes.The battery, like many other such devices, features a small LED light. It's a neat feature to have in case of an emergency, and I've used such a feature on a numerous occasions. It is not the brightest light you'll come across, but it gets the job done.The battery/recorder is overall well designed and looks and feels pretty solid. Most of these external power banks have a limited number of charge/discharge cycles. I am not sure how long this one would last, but I am guessing that it would be on par with other such devices in this category.The voice recording feature is something that truly distinguishes this power bank from many of the similar ones. It provides you with a quick, accessible and largely inconspicuous way of recording conversations. You turn on the voice recorder by holding the on/off button for three seconds, and similarly you turn it off by the same procedure. The quality of audio recordings that this recorder provides is pretty mediocre. I would not recommend it for music recording, but for voice it gets the job done. All the recordings are stored to the included micro SD card, and they are easily retrieved by transferring them to your computer.If you do need a quick and inconspicuous voice recorder, yet don't care about the professional or even good quality sound, then this recorder might be a good choice. Especially if you don't envision yourself using a recorder on a very regular basis. For very casual voice recording in a very simple and uncluttered environment I'd recommend that you just use the voice recording option on your smartphone. For more serious recording use you will be better off with a Sony or similar recorder.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****","overall":4.0,"summary":"Interesting and Useful Product","unixReviewTime":1403049600,"reviewTime":"2014-06-18T00:00:00"}

The 7800 mAh capacity is sufficient to charge your smartphone three to four times. Depending on a model it can also be sufficient for charging your tablet computer. I have tested it with iPhone 4S, Galaxy S3, and the first generation iPad. I was able to fully charge my iPad and had no problem charging iPhone and Galaxy several times.The power bank has a micro USB port that allows it to get charged. However, it doesn&#8217;t come with its own USB charger, so you are left to use one of your spare ones, or charge it by plugging it into a spare USB port on your computer.There are two regular USB ports on the front of this power bank. One supplies 1 A current and the other one a 2 A one. The lower one is usually used by smartphones, while tablets are charged via the higher one. However, these days either one of them can be used with almost any device. The only major difference will be the charging speed. Two USB ports also allow you to charge two device at the same time.Charging times will vary by the device, from just over an hour for a smaller device, to almost four hours for iPad. These times are more or less typical for external batteries/portable chargers that I have worked with. Charging of the power bank itself takes several hours, and is best done by leaving it plugged in overnight. There are a few small LED lights that tell you the total charge capacity remaining, which is a very useful feature.The most innovative feature of this power bank is that it doubles as a smartphone/tablet stand. The stand will support your smartphone or a tablet while it's being charged, or can be used as a stand-alone stand. The stand is a bot on the small side for a full-scale tablet stand. It works more than adequately for my iPhone, but I rarely, if ever, need a stand for it. I think that this stand is optimal for a 7&#34; to 8&#34; smaller tablet, but I have not been able to test it with any one of those to know for sure. The good thing about the stand is that it's easily foldable, so it doesn't add much bulkiness to the battery while you travel.There are a couple of features that some other power banks come with which would have made this an even more handy charger. My favorite is a pair of built-in wall outlet prongs. The second favorite is the wrap-around attached micro USB charging cable. Inclusion of those two features ensures that (if you have an Android phone for instance) you never have to worry about bringing along any other cables or chargers with you.Overall, this looks like a decent and innovative product and so far I have had pretty good experience with it.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****","overall":4.0,"summary":"Innovative and Effective","unixReviewTime":1403740800,"reviewTime":"2014-06-26T00:00:00"}

Even the small dedicated &#8220;waterproof&#8221; pockets in many of the shorts that I use are far from ideal. In my experience a dedicated armband or a pouch is the best option for keeping your smartphone safe and accessible while working out.This URGE Basics armband is one the most sophisticated and durable sports armband that I&#8217;ve come across. The armband is thick and comfortable, and it grips your upper arm very securely. The smartphone pouch is very large, and can fit almost any smartphone on the market right now. I&#8217;ve tested it with Galaxy S3 and iPhone 4S. The iPhone that I have actually has a very thick case, and I was still able to put it in. This is probably one of the nicest things about this URGE armband &#8211; most armbands are designed with a single device in mind that can only fit in without the protective case. The smartphone case also houses an additional small pocket which can be used to keep a credit card/ID, some cash, keys, or the coiled up headphones when they are not in use. The protective screen is very well made, it&#8217;s sweat-proof, and it allows you to still use the touchscreen of your phone. The bottom of the case has a small hidden opening that allows you to run the headphones cord through. In terms of its design, attention to details, and quality of materials this armband is second to none.A unique feature of this armband is its inclusion of bright LED lights. This is a great idea, and very nice safety feature for people who like to run outdoors, especially in lower visibility. The LED lights run off of two included button cell batteries. The batteries are easy to install and replace, but the battery compartment requires that you use a coin to pry it open. The lights are pretty bright, and although I have only tested them a couple of times, they seem to work as intended. They provide three lighting modes - solid, flicker, and flash. I personally prefer flicker - it seems to grab most attention.I really like this armband and intend to use it as one of my primary gym accessory from now on.

In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's large, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external battery that I've come across in terms of capacity (with impressive 10,400 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S, iPhone 3G, Kindle Keyboard, Mobee Magic Bar, Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generation iPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged LifeCHARGE battery.

As you would expect, the more expensiveVSonic GR07shave a bit more detail on direct comparison but to be clear, in practical use this not an issue, especially when out-and-about.  The GR02s are also slightly weighted more to bass and are slightly louder at equal volume.The soundstage is not quite as expansive the GR07s but is still remarkable for in-ear microphones--especially in this price range--and is comparable to even some of my over-the-ear headphones, very rich and atmospheric.The tips don't have the hard tube inside like the GR07 Sony-style ones.  Make sure that you choose tips that fit your ear canal or, as with any in-ear monitor, you won't get good sound, especially for bass.  The sample set I received has three pairs of regular silicone tips and one flanged pair, all of which fit quite securely on the stem, plus a cord clip and a velveteen pouch.  VSonic seems to change the packaging and accessories on their headphones frequently and they may now be shipping with extra tips as a bonus.Between the sound quality and price, these VSonic GR02s are perfect for everyday use, even for audiophiles.  Honestly, I am too much of a worry-wart to use expensive earphones when running errands.  They are comfortable enough that I forget they're in my ears, they produce very enjoyable sound, and are a true bargain.

They are made for portable devices and come with two single-entry cables, a black standard cable and also a bright BlueAnt-blue cable with a microphone and controls, which work quite well with Apple electronics.Unfortunately, they are not nearly as comfortable as they look. The earpieces swivel about thirty degrees but only in one plane. Hold the earpieces in the correct place with the palms while swiveling the headband with the long fingers to find an acceptable spot for it to rest. No matter how good the placement, the headband exerts significant pressure and flattens the ears down against the side of the head. It's like a rigged wrestling match: the ears lose every time.This might be acceptable except that the fat puffy cushioning turns out to be memory foam and it just isn't dense enough. After a few minutes, the hard surfaces under the foam are pressing against the already-flattened ears. It's simply not tolerable for more than a few minutes. The earpieces also hold a lot of heat for on-ear headphones and don't even do a good job of excluding noise. Some denser foam would probably make them much more comfortable, in line with their appearance.The overall sound quality is mediocre. There's not a lot of detail to start with and with any increase in volume, instrumental bass distorts terribly and there are huge amounts of sibilance in voices--and sibilance is not something I am particularly sensitive to. At times, the sound turns into an unpleasant distorted mess that is difficult to listen to.The ambience is not bad for an on-ear closed-back headphone and soundstage is much better than I would expect considering the other problems. There doesn't seem to be much impedance and volume is good even with the portable devices.BlueAnt claims that these are \"highly optimized drivers for pure and detailed sound\" such as those found in higher-range headphone and, apart from the low-density foam, the design and the quality of materials and construction are inconsistent with the sound they are actually producing.I am giving these BlueAnt Embrace Stereo Headphones a gentleman's \"C\" with three stars because I think it is more likely than not that the pair I received for review is defective.","overall":3.0,"summary":"BlueAnt Headlock Stereo Headphones","unixReviewTime":1345852800,"reviewTime":"2012-08-25T00:00:00"}

The included cables should be used in the 1 A port for optimal speed when charging non-Apple devices and Apple cables should be used with Apple devices.Output is up to 3 A simultaneously. The power output is shared between the 2 A outlets so if both of them or all three ports were used simultaneously, charging would be limited to 1 A per device. Practically, there is little reason to charge more than 2 devices at a time.Two cables of different lengths and two micro-USB tips for recharging the juice pack were thoughtfully included so the cables can be left in different locations such as at home and at the office. Several other adapters are also included for charging electronics from the power bank. The juice pack itself can charge from a USB port on a computer or television or from a USB wall adapter. It is a smart charger that will turn itself off once it reaches capacity. I was pleasantly surprised that it was delivered already fully-charged. When completely discharged, it will recharge overnight from a USB wall adapter.There are four blue LED indicators to show how much capacity remains. After charging a Samsung cell phone that still had half a charge and an iPod shuffle full discharged, all four indicator lights were still on, which demonstrates the high capacity of this model.As a bonus, there is a bright-white LED flashlight that is very useful and makes this power bank ideal to keep in the glove compartment for emergencies.The only tricky thing is that it is necessary to remember to press the button to turn it on for charging.

It has a distinctive design and a cohesive look across all the components.  I was surprised that the ribbon-shaped Bluetooth receiver doesn't swivel or clamp--it just slides on and off the fabric of the placket or pocket or hem of an article of clothing--but it does stay put.  The embossed controls are hard to see but are quite intuitive and are easy to use by touch.  I was quite pleased when it established a connection with the computer immediately as I have had trouble getting some Bluetooth devices to pair.However, the audio quality was absolutely horrible and completely unusable for listening to music.  It wasn't just the included headphones--it was terrible with five or six pairs.  I finally gave up on this device and was so disappointed that I stuck it up on the top shelf of a bookcase out of sight.However, I really wanted to be able to use headphones wirelessly so I tried again a week later.  Same problem: thin, flat, distant, poor audio quality.I re-read the product description and especially about the aptX codec which promised high-quality Bluetooth streaming.  I did a little googling and found out that sometimes there are problems with the aptX not being enabled especially when multiple Bluetooth devices are already in use.  I also saw in the computer system preferences for audio that that the default setting for this device isn't stereo so I changed it to stereo.  I played around with it for a while, turning the Ribbon on and off, turning the Bluetooth on and off, disconnecting the mouse and keyboard, pairing it again, turning the Ribbon on and off, etc.  I finally figured out that the computer needs to be restarted while the Ribbon is in use.  That changes some setting so that listening to music with the Ribbon is then not too different than plugging the headphones directly into the audio-out port on the Mac Mini.So I am now pleased with this device. I don't particularly care for the ribbon design nor the tarpaulin-blue color and I despise the pilferage-preventing polystyrene box it was packaged in but it works quite well with any headphones anywhere in the room with the computer to listen to music.  When I go into another room, the audio breaks up and then stops completely but it picks right back up when I go back into the room with the computer.  The battery life is over five hours when listening to music continuously.Besides the receiver, it comes with an okay pair of in-ear headphones, three sizes of silicone earbuds, a USB charging cable, a USB wall charger, and a cable to connect the receiver to other audio output devices such as a car sound system or Bluetooth speaker set.  It will also stream music from the computer to a Philips iPod dock with the included cable.Overall, the BlueAnt Ribbon is a functional little Bluetooth receiver that could be improved with a clip design although aspects of the streaming technology other than the device itself can be a bit persnickety.  I enjoy the convenience of being able to wear whatever headphones I'm in the mood for without being tethered to the computer or having to use the iPod.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Good audio quality, persnickety technology","unixReviewTime":1357344000,"reviewTime":"2013-01-05T00:00:00"}

Battery capacity has become a major issue, especially when electricity is not available.  Power banks have become quite popular as a result and they are continuously improving in efficiency, features, and ease of use.Bolse's new AON range incorporates lithium ion batteries for long use over at least 500 cycles and for a high efficiency of over 75% when charging devices.  They are quite attractive and the buttons and LED indicators are easy to use and the ports all have clear labeling.  They feel solid in the hand and are quite sturdy.All of them come with multiple adapters and outlets for charging different types of devices but I do recommend using the charging cord that comes with the device when possible and carefully reading the instructions for the power banks.  The power banks will recharge much faster from an AC adapter than from a USB port and it's easiest to leave them plugged in to charge overnight.Before choosing a particular model, decide what devices it will be used to charge and check compatibility.  Then decide what capacity is needed, understanding that as capacity increases, the size, weight, and cost all increase, as well.The Bolse AON2 is designed to carry in a bag, briefcase, or to keep in a glove compartment for several charges of a cellphone or mp3 player or even a major power boost for an iPad mini or Kindle Paperwhite.  It has a nominal capacity of 8,000 mAh, which is quite generous for occasional or emergency use.

They are very handsome, with attention to proportion, detail, materials and construction. They are a pleasure to use, combining quality audio with painless Bluetooth connection, intuitive controls, and a comfortable fit.The headband is about 1 1/4 inches wide and is padded with at the top. Unlike some over-the-ear headphones, these apply just the right amount of pressure to stay in place yet remain comfortable over extended periods. Each earpiece can be precisely adjusted within a 1 1/2 inch range for exact fit. They also swivel about 15 degrees in all directions and have exactly the right thickness of padding for comfort and isolation without bottoming out. The padding is covered with a protein leather that is very soft and is not prone to retaining heat and moisture. I am very pleased with the fit and comfort of these headphones even after several hours of continuous use.The Bluetooth is the latest generation and the CSR8645 chip uses the aptX codec so it is audibly equivalent to a wired connection. Range is about 30 feet, the same as my other Bluetooth devices. The microphone for telephone use is clear, although it does pick up ambient noise. They are HD voice-enabled, and that technology began being implemented by U.S. telephony carriers in early 2013.The VOXO&#581; headphones are intended for use with portable devices but the sound quality produced by the 40 mm drivers is pleasant enough for everyday use. The sound is as good as similar headphones selling for twice the price and is up to the standards set by their appearance and comfort.Sound isolation is good for on-ear headphones, so that while listening to music, ambient noise is dampened but not completely excluded. Spatial ambiance and soundstage are better than most on-ear headphones, although certainly not as good as what would be expected from an open-back, over-the-ear headphone. Impedance is average; as with all headphones, it is best to turn the source volume up and then adjust the listening volume with the headphone controls.The sound is well-balanced with the slight bass emphasis that is expected in portable headphones&#8212;but it is not at the expense of treble. I was pleasantly surprised that flutes and violins were just as full and detailed as bass instruments. I have never noticed any muddiness, sibilance, or other distortion. These are quite versatile headphones and the sound quality is higher than average, certainly much better than would be expected in this price range.They are shipped in a sturdy box that can be used for storage or they can be folded to under 4 x 7 x 2 1/2 in. to fit in the stretchy sueded storage pouch. A USB charging cable is included as well as a 38 in. 3.5 mm audio cable; either will to allow them to be used as wired headphones without relying on the rechargeable battery or Bluetooth.The instruction pamphlet is easy to follow and organizes control functions in charts for easy reference. I didn't actually need to refer to it as there is nothing tricky about the way these headphones work. There is also a very generous warranty.Three hours of charging the lithium ion battery will give at least fourteen hours of listening at moderate volume.

These state-of-the-art batteries are designed specifically for power banks and simply perform better than most: they are slightly more efficient, hold a charge longer, lose capacity at a significantly lower rate, and can sustain many more charging cycles. They also have superior protection circuitry against charging problems such as high voltage input or absolute discharge. Maximum capacity is achieved after cycling multiple times and then this power bank can fully charge a Samsung Chromebook, an iPhone. and an Android phone, plus an iPod Shuffle multiple times.The USB charging ports, micro USB power port, and charge button are all located on one end. There are four blue LED indicators on the top to show remaining capacity in roughly 25% increments and they flash when charging a device and stop flashing when it is fully charged. The micro USB to USB power input cable is included and devices are charged with their own cables. I do prefer to charge the powerbank itself with a USB wall adapter rather than a USB port.It is shipped fully charged but it doesn't come with instructions so here are a couple of tips: Although you should check the instructions for your particular device, generally use the 2.1 A output with all Apple devices and most other devices tablet-size or larger and the 1.0 A output for most smaller devices.

People who use the USB ports on the computer or older wall chargers with only 2.1 A will really appreciate the faster charging times for devices that can accommodate 4 A.  The higher output is maintained even when all four USB ports are in use.Those ports are underneath to ease cord tangle and strain and are clearly labelled. All are universal for use with most devices including the newer ones from Apple.  One is also designed to also be compatible with older Apple devices and another with Samsung devices but not with iPad.  It sounds confusing, but iPad and Galaxy owners are familiar with these issues!To get the best use from any USB charger, it is important to understand the requirements of each device and its battery. Manufacturers provide this information; Apple's website, for instance, provides a full page of information about each device's battery. iPad batteries should be completely discharged and then fully recharged monthly, while iPod batteries don't need to be cycled. Some electronics should be turned off or put in sleep mode for charging under certain circumstances. It definitely is worth the time to learn about these requirements.This Bolse wall charger works very well as a permanent charging station but it is also convenient for travel.  It weighs 4 oz. and is just a tad over 3 in. long.  The offset non-polarized prongs are well-protected but are easy to unfold, and they are secure in the wall outlet or power strip.

But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Extraordinarily useful and much less expensive than auto manufacturers' inverters","unixReviewTime":1379376000,"reviewTime":"2013-09-17T00:00:00"}

A number of manufacturers are making external battery packs, and the field is becoming more crowded every year. New Trent has been making these products longer than most manufacturers, and the company's experience shows in their latest product, the IMP120D iCarrier battery charger. With a rated capacity of 12,000 mAh, a fully charged IMP120D is capable of recharging several mobile devices or giving several recharges to a single device. I tested the IMP120D by charging two of my devices simultaneously, using both of the unit's USB output ports. The results were as follows:* Samsung Stratosphere smartphone. The phone had a 65% charge when I connected the IMP120D. In about 90 minutes, the phone was at 100%.* Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet. The tablet had a 69% charge when I connected the IMP120D. In about 80 minutes, the tablet was at 100%.The recharging times for both devices were roughly comparable to recharging with an AC wall charger. After recharging the two devices, the IMP120D was still showing three LED lights. I'm not certain, but with most rechargers, this indicates 75%-100% remaining capacity. To recharge a depleted IMP120D, the user guide indicates that approximately ten hours are required with the included 5V~2A AC wall charger. For most users, an overnight charging would be sufficient.Cosmetically, the IMP120D is an attractive all-metal case with matte black finish and blue trim and smoothly rounded edges. As external battery chargers go, it's fairly heavy (10 ounces) and big (3.9\"x3.7\"x1.1\"). That's the tradeoff for the 12,000 mAh capacity. The recharger comes with a soft fabric drawstring pouch for carrying it in.The recharging kit includes the AC wall charger, a Micro USB charging cable, and a charging cable for the Samsung Galaxy Tab. It does not include an Apple charging cable, although the charger is compatible with iOS devices.Overall, I'm very impressed with the New Trent IMP120D iCarrier battery charger.

Chambers","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"The 5-6-hour battery life typical of many cellphones is barely enough for heavy telephone usage, much less the texting, emails, location services, and apps that drain batteries. Since it's not always possible to be near an AC charger or car charger, an external battery pack is a must-have for many people. Based on my experience with these battery packs, I think there are four important things to consider when shopping for one:1. Form factor. I'm including both size and weight. You'll most likely be carrying the charger in your pocket, purse, or glove compartment of your vehicle. How convenient is that going to be?2. Capacity. Rechargers come in a range of capacities from about 2,500 mAh to as high as 12,000 mAh. Figure that 2,300-2,500 mAh is about the equivalent power of a rechargeable AA NiMH battery, and that may give you some idea of the battery pack's capacity. Mobile devices will vary a lot in how much capacity it takes to recharge their internal batteries, with the larger tablets requiring considerably more power than a small cellphone.3. Reliability. As with any other product, go with brand names you're familiar with, or ones with good reviews that you trust.4. Compatibility with your hardware. I once bought an inexpensive battery pack that came with seven different adapter cables. I think there was a cable for just about every device under the sun except my cellphone. I had to order the cable for several dollars plus shipping, and it took two weeks for delivery. Make sure the battery pack you buy has an adapter for your device.-------------------------------------PowerGen sent me one of their PGMPP6000 External Battery Pack units to review. Having used an older model PowerGen 8,400 mAh unit, I expected the 6,000 mAh battery pack to be well made, and it was. It included cables and adapter plugs for almost all devices sold today, but the product description does list specific exceptions that are not covered.Three features that I really liked:1. A built-in LED flashlight.2. Two USB outputs (2.0 amp and 0.6 amp) so you can charge two devices at once. Check the device that you're recharging to determine which output is most appropriate.3. This is a really nice feature that has been added - an imbedded 2-amp micro-USB output cable that fits neatly into the case. You could actually charge three devices at once, although this would significantly limit the charging capacity available for each device.The product guide indicated that a full recharge of the battery pack from an AC adapter would require about 6-7 hours, depending on the output of the AC adapter (or car charger) used to recharge it. For me, that's not much of an issue, since I recharge my cellphone and tablet overnight.Note that the battery pack can be recharged from a PC through a USB port, but that takes 12-14 hours. Most users will want to use an AC wall charger with a USB cable. There are dozens of these on the market, including chargers made by PowerGen.I tested the PowerGen battery pack on my Samsung smartphone and my Nexus 7 tablet long enough to see the battery charge increase by 20%-25%. I also tested the battery pack on my wife's iPhone 4 and Amazon Kindle HD, and it worked fine. The next time my Kindle e-Ink reader needs recharging, I'll try it with the PowerGen.Overall, I'm very impressed with the PowerGen mobile \"Juice Pack.\" It appears to be well made, it's very compact, it looks great, and it works very well with all of our mobile devices.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A very nicely designed battery pack","unixReviewTime":1352246400,"reviewTime":"2012-11-07T00:00:00"}

I plugged it into an electrical outlet, and about two hours later, it was fully charged. The product description indicates that a full charge can be restored to a drained battery pack in 9-10 hours with the included 5.3V/1A AC adapter. I also tried recharging the battery pack with a PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Charger. I didn't time the recharging with the PowerGen AC adapter, but with 10 watts of power, it should reduce the charging time by as much as 50%.I've tested the battery pack with several mobile devices that we have, including a Kindle Fire, Kindle 3 (aka Kindle Keyboard), iPhone 4, and a Samsung Stratosphere cellphone, and it worked as advertised to extend the battery life. I did not attempt to quantify exactly how much extension of battery life it provided, but with 8400 mAh of power, it should be significant, even with the higher power consumption of devices like the Kindle Fire.The battery pack kit contained two cables (identical except for the length) and five different plug types, including an Apple plug, a micro USB plug, and two others that I didn't recognize (there were two of the micro USB plugs).

The port next to the flashlight is labeled 0.6A and the other port is labeled 2A, but the labels are very hard to read. (It's much easier to read if you look on the side of the case, where the labels are easier to read below their respective ports.)Just a reminder: Any rechargeable battery loses some of its charge every day, so if you keep this or any other battery pack in your purse or backpack or briefcase, you need to take it out occasionally and recharge it.The bottom line: A very handy, indispensable little gadget for anyone on the go whose cellphone or other small electronic devices run out of battery power and an AC or vehicle charger is not available.Note: The seller offered to send me a PowerGen Duo-Power External Battery Pack 8400mAh to test and review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"An indispensable device for people on the go with mobile devices","unixReviewTime":1333152000,"reviewTime":"2012-03-31T00:00:00"}

And it successfully does both. It's simple enough to use: unfold the prongs and plug the device into an AC outlet, and it recharges its own internal battery. Then it's ready to use as a portable charger when your cellphone battery runs low on power. With 1800mAh capacity, it's just enough to add a few hours of talk time to a cellphone, but if that's all you typically need, it's enough. I charged up the device, unplugged it, then connected it to my Samsung phone using the built-in USB cable with a micro-USB plug. The phone was initially at 70%, and after one hour, it was charged to 96%. That's pretty good performance, comparable to other portable chargers that I've used. Note that the phone was turned on while it was being recharged and was used for a couple of calls.At 3\"x2.6\"x0.9\" and weighing about four ounces, the sturdy metal case is portable enough to slip into a pocket or a bag. The built-in micro-USB plug means you'll never be without a charging cable. There's also another USB cable included that can be used with a USB port on the end of the device, although realistically, it's stretching it for a low-capacity device to charge two phones simultaneously - but it's possible to do it in an emergency.My verdict: This is a handy device for people who occasionally need to extend their phone's battery charge.

The soft tip is very similar on both, and the tips work very well on capacitive touchscreens. (I used the stylus on a Kindle Fire HDX and an Android phone.) However, the Sty-HD stylus has a very handy pocket clip, which the Amazon stylus lacks, as well as an opening at the top for attaching a lanyard.I have to give the nod to the Sty-HD stylus.

This is the highest-capacity Juice Pack currently made by PowerGen, with 12,000 mAh stated capacity. The tradeoff from lower-capacity models is that it's also the largest Juice Pack in size (3.8\"x3.3\"x.89\") and weight (8.7 oz). PowerGen often adds some innovative feature to each newer model, and in this case, it's their first external battery pack with three charging ports (although the earlier PGMPP9000 had two ports plus a built-in cable with a Micro-USB plug). In appearance, it's similar to other Juice Packs, with a sleek black case with white trim and polished metal surfaces that look sturdy enough to take some rough handling.Two features that I really liked:1. A built-in LED flashlight.2. Three USB outputs that provide for charging up to three devices at once. The three output ports are labeled \"Out A,\" \"Out S,\" and \"Out 1 Amp.\" Ports \"A\" and \"S\" share 2 amps, and \"Out 1 Amp\" independently outputs up to 1 Amp.The product guide indicated that a full recharge of the battery pack from an AC adapter would require about 8-10 hours for a 2 Amp adapter, and 15-17 hours with a 1 Amp adapter. When I received the unit, all four LED charge indicator lights were on, meaning a 75%-100% charge. Using a PowerGen dual USB 3.1A 15w AC adapter, I topped off the charge for about an hour, then connected three devices (Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablet, Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, and my wife's iPhone 4 to the Juice Pack's charging ports. The three devices had charge levels ranging from 50%-80% when I connected them. After about an hour, the battery charge for each device had increased by at least 15%, so it was clear that the Juice Pack had the capacity to charge three devices simultaneously.The unit includes adapters for most mobile devices, including PlayStation Portable (4mm round), Nokia (2mm round), Mini-USB, Apple, and two Micro-USB adapters. There are two charging cables (27\" and 7\") which do double duty for connecting the Juice Pack to a recharging source (usually an AC wall outlet or a vehicle charging port) and for connecting the Juice Pack to a mobile device. These should cover the vast majority of mobile devices on the market today. The product guide specifically excludes the Asus Transformer, however.It's possible to recharge the Juice Pack from the USB port of a PC, but it may require up to 30 hours. Realistically, most people will use an AC wall charger or vehicle charging port to recharge the Juice Pack. From having used an earlier model Juice Pack, I know the PowerGen units hold their charge very well, but they should be \"topped off\" occasionally if they're not recharged regularly.Overall, I'm very impressed with the PowerGen PGMPP12000 12000mAh Juice Pack. It has excellent build quality, it's reasonably compact, it looks great, and it works very well with all of our mobile devices.The manufacturer sent me one of their PGMPP12000 12000mAh Mobile Juice Pack units to review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A reliable high-capacity external battery pack","unixReviewTime":1358294400,"reviewTime":"2013-01-16T00:00:00"}

Since it's not always possible to be near an AC charger or car charger, an external battery pack is a must-have for many people. Based on my experience with these battery packs, I think there are four important things to consider when shopping for one:1. Form factor. I'm including both size and weight. You'll most likely be carrying the charger in your pocket, purse, or glove compartment of your vehicle. How convenient is that going to be?2. Capacity. Rechargers come in a range of capacities from about 2,500 mAh to as high as 12,000 mAh. Figure that 2,300-2,500 mAh is about the equivalent power of a rechargeable AA NiMH battery, and that may give you some idea of the battery pack's capacity. Mobile devices will vary a lot in how much capacity it takes to recharge their internal batteries, with the larger tablets requiring considerably more power than a small cellphone.3. Reliability. As with any other product, go with brand names you're familiar with, or ones with reviews that you trust.4. Compatibility with your hardware. I once bought an inexpensive battery pack that came with seven different adapter cables. I think there was a cable for just about every device under the sun except my cellphone. I had to order the cable for several dollars plus shipping, and it took two weeks for delivery. Make sure the battery pack you buy has an adapter for your device.-------------------------------------PowerGen sent me one of their PGMPP9000 External Battery Pack units to review. Having used an older model PowerGen 8,400 mAh unit, I expected the 9,000 mAh battery pack to be well made, and it was. It included cables and adapter plugs for almost all devices sold today, but the product description does list specific exceptions that are not covered.Three features that I really liked:1. A built-in LED flashlight.2. Two USB outputs (2.0 amp and 0.6 amp) so you can charge two devices at once. Check the device that you're recharging to determine which output is most appropriate.3. This is a really nice feature that has been added - an imbedded 2-amp micro-USB output cable that fits neatly into the case. You could actually charge three devices at once, although this would significantly limit the charging capacity available for each device.The product guide indicated that a full recharge of the battery pack from an AC adapter would require about 6-10 hours, depending on the output of the AC adapter (or car charger) used to recharge it. For me, that's not much of an issue, since I recharge my cellphone and tablet overnight.Note that the battery pack can be recharged from a PC through a USB port, but that takes 18-20 hours. Most users will want to use an AC wall charger with a USB cable. There are dozens of these on the market, including chargers made by PowerGen.I tested the PowerGen battery pack on my Samsung smartphone and my Nexus 7 tablet long enough to see the battery charge increase by 20%-25%. I also tested the battery pack on my wife's iPhone 4 and Amazon Kindle HD, and it worked fine.

The charger still had more than 50% capacity remaining.Allowing for some electrical losses, the PowerPak 13,500mAh charger has enough capacity to recharge most cellphones (typical batteries have 1400-2000mAh) 5-6 times, and small tablets (typical batteries have 4000-5000mAh) at least 2-3 times; with larger tablets, you would get at least one full recharge. The tradeoff for so much capacity is, of course, the size and weight of the charger. Weighing in at about eleven ounces, this is no lightweight, but it's only 4-5 ounces more than chargers with one third the capacity, so it's not a bad tradeoff if you need the capacity and can't afford to lose power during an important phone call. The two charging ports are labeled \"2.1A for tablets\" and \"1A for smartphones.\" Most mobile devices will charge satisfactorily from either port, although the 2.1A port will be faster.The charger itself is a plastic (polycarbonate, I think) case that feels quite solid and durable. The corners are mitered, which should help prevent cracking if the case is accidentally dropped. Unlike most chargers that have four LED lights to indicate the charge status, the PowerPak has a unique color-coded system which shows green when the charge is 75% or more, then blue, then red.The PowerPak is a bit bigger than most people would want to carry around in a pocket, but it fits nicely in a backpack or any kind of carrying case. After using the charger for the last few days, I recommend it as an accessory for any small mobile device that charges with a USB cable. (Note: one cable is included, with a Micro-USB plug that fits many mobile devices.)A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A much needed accessory for users of mobile devices","unixReviewTime":1376006400,"reviewTime":"2013-08-09T00:00:00"}

Keep in mind, however, that cellphones typically like about 1.0 Amp for quickest charging, and small tablets like around 2.0 Amps, so you could charge two bigger tablets simultaneously with the iFlash charger, but the recharge time would be longer than if you were only charging one device. For most people who charge their devices overnight for 7-8 hours, I doubt if the slower recharging speed would matter. I tested the iFlash overnight with an Android cellphone and a Kindle Fire HD 7\" tablet, and both were recharged to 100% (both had been run down to about 20-25% when the test began). There was no overheating of the charger or the two mobile devices.By comparison, the Amazon Kindle PowerFast AC charger has an output of 1.8 Amps, has only one port, and costs considerably more than the iFlash.This is a very compact charger - 2\"x2\"x1\", weighing barely two ounces, and the plugs swing into a recess when not in use.

And it's built like a brick. The all-metal case looks like you could sit on it without damaging it.After receiving the charger, I charged it overnight using a 5V~1.0A AC adapter. Then I used it to recharge my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD. The Kindle Fire initially had a 31% charge. After 142 minutes, the Kindle Fire was charged to 100%. That's about 0.5% per minute, which is about the same speed that I've had with other 1 Amp portable chargers. The Kindle Fire has a 4400mAh battery, so if the battery was recharged 69% of its capacity, the Jackery Air provided 0.69 x 4400 = 3036mAh. Not including electrical losses, that means the 5000mAh charger had about 1964mAh remaining capacity, or 39% of its original capacity. After the charging was completed, a steady red light was indicating the charge state of the charger. According to the user guide, a steady red light means the charger had 10%-40% of capacity remaining, which agrees with the arithmetic.I can recommend the Jackery Air 5000mAh charger for anyone who has moderate needs to recharge their cellphone or small tablet while they're on the go. With a 1A output, it's not the fastest charger around, but if speed isn't a big issue, that may not matter so much to many users. Also, the Jackery has only one charging port, so it can't be used to charge two or more mobile devices simultaneously. So if you need a very fast charger with the capacity to recharge large tablets or multiple devices simultaneously, the Jackery Air 5000mAh charger is not for you. But if you have more modest needs, the charger should give at least two full recharges for most cellphones, and one full recharge for most 7&#34; tablets.I really liked the charger. It's almost exactly the same size as my Moto X, and it's thin enough that I could put my phone on top of it and hold them in one hand while using the phone and charging it at the same time.

It's not too likely that most people would need to charge three devices at the same time, but the Incredicharge has the capability to do it. (The rated total output is 2A.

At just over 7 ounces, the battery pack is no lightweight, but considering that it's been sealed for water resistance, the extra ounce or so is a fair trade-off.

With some music, there was noticeable distortion at the maximum volume, but this volume was loud enough to hurt my ears. At normal sound levels, there was no noticeable distortion. I'm not sure what the maximum operating range is, but I roamed all over our house with no dropouts.The headset battery is not intended to be recharged from a USB port. The included AC charger has an output of 5v/180mA. That's a very low output current (much less than most AC adapters), so it's important to not misplace the adapter. One minor complaint: The cable from the AC adapter to the headset is only 12\" long.The medium-size earbuds that were installed with the earphones worked fine for me, but the accessories included a set of small and large earbuds. With the three sizes available, these should fit almost anyone comfortably.I'm impressed with the Jabra PLAY headset. It appears to be very solidly made, and the designers have done a very nice job of putting a lot of technology into such a small device.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A very capable headset with the freedom of Bluetooth","unixReviewTime":1374537600,"reviewTime":"2013-07-23T00:00:00"}

In addition to the Bluetooth connection, the speakers accept input from a 3.5mm audio cable and directly from SD memory cards. There's also a built-in FM radio.I first tried the Bluetooth connection. The speakers paired easily with my Nexus 7 tablet and played music from one of my favorite playlists. Even at maximum volume, the sound clarity with four watts of total output was quite good, and the two speakers are separated enough (about 6&#34;) to give decent stereo. Next I ended the Bluetooth connection and connected the speakers to the tablet with the audio cable. That worked well, and in this hard-wired mode, the volume can be controlled from either the audio source or the CSR speakers.After copying a few MP3 music files to an SDHC memory card, I inserted the card into the slot on the back of the speakers, turned on the speakers, and played music. The music began playing automatically as soon as I turned the power on to the speakers. That's remarkable - I've never seen another set of portable speakers with that capability.There are a number of powerful FM radio stations in our town, so I had no problem bringing in FM stations. I have to say, though, that it's a little clunky looking for favorite stations without a tuner. But the seek function did work pretty well.There's also a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back of the speakers.Another unique feature is the replaceable rechargeable battery in the speakers. It's a Nokia BL-5C Extended Li-Ion battery, and they cost about $5 at Amazon to replace one or to have extra ones charged up to carry with you. The battery can be charged inside the speakers from a DC 5V source and the included charging cable. The user manual doesn't specify the maximum current, but I put it on a DC 5V~1.0A charger for a couple of hours, and it was fine.My only negative comment - and it's a minor one - is that the bottom of the speakers has four little plastic nubs to rest on. A rubberized base would make it more skidproof if it's bumped.With attractive styling, excellent sound quality and volume for its size, the multiple media inputs, and an FM radio, this is perhaps the most versatile portable speakers that I've seen.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"One of the most versatile Bluetooth speakers I've seen","unixReviewTime":1382227200,"reviewTime":"2013-10-20T00:00:00"}

Now Grace Digital is back with the ECOROX wireless Bluetooth speaker. It's roughly half the size of the previous speaker (and weighs 11 ounces vs. 24 ounces), and the manufacturer claims that it's completely waterproof in up to three feet of water. I didn't test the watertightness, but I did put the ECOROX through its paces with two tablets: a Nexus 7 and a Kindle Fire HD 7\". The audio quality is remarkably good for a unit this small, even more so considering that the speakers are waterproofed. The two front-mounted stereo speakers pump out six watts of clean sound, which blends with a top-mounted bass speaker to produce music with a richness that belies the ECOROX's small size.Connecting and pairing the Bluetooth was very simple and only took a few seconds for each tablet. The ECOROX was able to control the volume of the sound (the volume control in the tablet works also), and the ECOROX controls would advance to the next song on a playlist or return to the previous song. In other words, keep the ECOROX within reach and control your music with it, while your tablet or smartphone can be up to 30+ feet away. I also hardwired the ECOROX to the tablet, and that worked fine (note that the waterproof seal must be open to access the 3.5mm jack, so you lose watertightness while it's hardwired). By the way, my primary interest in the ECOROX is for music, but the great sound quality makes gaming a whole new experience.I seldom use my smartphone as a telephone, so I didn't try the hands-free call feature, but I can definitely see the ECOROX being used with my phone's GPS to amplify the voice directions over the road noise.The ECOROX does not include an AC charger, but the user guide indicates that one can be used instead of recharging from a PC's USB port.

When she's not using it, it's somewhere in the bottomless pit of her purse, being beat on with her keys, makeup, and all the other stuff she carries in it. The flexible screen protectors that we've put on it help, but none have lasted more than a few months, so I was looking forward to seeing if the Bionic Shield was as good as its promotional video looked [search for \"Bionic Shield\" on YouTube - it's the 2:19 video].The screen protector was pretty easy to apply. The key is to make sure the screen is completely free of dust and fingerprints before applying the tempered glass protector. The screen protector kit includes a little microfiber cloth and alcohol pad to help with this. Then it's a simple matter of applying the iPhone's Home button and protector, and using the included squeegee card to remove any bubbles of air. A silicone adhesive keeps the screen protector attached. Note: The install guide that's packaged with the kit is very general. Before installing the screen protector, be sure to watch the YouTube video for very clear instructions (it's brief, only about 2 minutes). [[...]The sensitivity of the iPhone's screen to touches and swipes did not appear to be significantly affected by the screen protector. And since the kit included a new Home button, the button worked normally.

The Beats Audio on my laptop is good, but it can't compare with the 3-watt output of the VicTsing speaker. For a real treat, turn out the room lights and watch the multi-colored lightshow the speaker puts on in sync with the music.To try out the Bluetooth function, I paired the speaker with our Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7. Pairing was very quick (note: I did have to type in the password \"0000\"). With the speaker, I was able to control the volume, pause, and forward/back on a playlist. I also successfully paired the speaker with my wife's iPhone 4.I'm no expert audiophile, but the sound quality was excellent to my ears. The speaker has a unique design that radiates the sound evenly in all directions, more so than any other portable speaker that I've used. I moved the speaker away from the audio source, and only beyond about 25-30 feet away through two interior walls did I start to get dropouts.The VicTsing portable Bluetooth speaker is stylish, appears to be solidly made and durable, and has excellent sound, all in a 4\" diameter ball. The bottom of the speaker is flattened and has a rubberized surface that keeps the speaker from sliding if it's bumped. The speaker's internal battery is recharged by plugging a USB cable (included) into a USB port. The port on the speaker is for a micro-USB plug, but the user manual doesn't mention charging the battery with an AC wall charger. I contacted the manufacturer about this, and the response was that the speaker can be recharged with an AC wall charger that produces 5 volts DC with 1-2 amps.

It has a unique design, with a micro-USB cable wound around the outside of the case so you can't lose it.No AC charger is included, but most users probably already own several AC chargers. The user guide indicates that the DC input is 5V with a maximum charging current of 1.5 Amps. I used a Kindle charger that output 1.0A to charge the PBS unit overnight.

The next afternoon, I used it to recharge my Android smartphone, and afterward I topped off the charge in my 7&#34; tablet. The PBS output is DC 5V~1A, which is okay for just about any cellphone or tablet. The user guide indicates that the charging current can be toggled between 1.0 Amp and 0.5 Amps by pushing the on/off button, but I recommend that you use the default 1.0 Amp, which is safe for virtually all mobile devices.The PBS charger has only one USB charging port. I've seen chargers with this capacity that had two ports, which allow recharging two devices simultaneously. That's not a big negative, but it's something to consider when choosing a portable charger. I do have a slightly negative comment: the USB cable that stores on the charger is a thick piece of rubber. The ends of the cable have to be straightened out before the plugs are inserted into a port on a PC or a mobile device.

Now there's a nifty way around that problem with the VicTsing Bluetooth audio receiver adapter. The adapter syncs with an audio source like a tablet or cell phone through Bluetooth, then pushes the audio into a speaker system through a standard 3.5mm audio cable. I tried doing that with a set of speakers that I've used with my home computers for several years. It worked perfectly with my Nexus 7 tablet. Pairing was very quick, with the adapter being recognized as device \"LinK-485.\"But what excited me most about the VicTsing audio receiver adapter was using it to send the audio output from the Nexus 7 into my car's sound system. My car has a 3.5mm audio port in the center console. I had already paired the adapter with the Nexus 7, so it was just a matter of plugging it in and turning it on. I hit AUX on the audio controls, and - voil&agrave; - music filled the car.After playing around with the adapter for a couple of days, I have to say this is a cool little device for both the home and any vehicles with audio input jacks. It's very compact and weighs only two ounces. I found it to be very quick and easy to pair with my mobile devices. (The adapter has NFC [Near Field Communication] capability. The Nexus 7 also has this capability, but I had already paired the tablet and adapter the conventional way before I remembered this.)The adapter kit includes a 4-foot 3.5mm audio cable and a 24\" USB cable with a Mini-B plug for charging the adapter's internal 250mAh battery from a PC. The user manual doesn't mention charging the battery from an AC wall charger or car charger. I'm guessing that's possible, but I need to ask the manufacturer about that before I try it.

For reasons that make no sense to me, the part of the charger that slides into the car's power port (located in the dashboard) is rectangular, not the usual round shape. Because of this, the charger jiggles a bit. The metal compression spring contacts hold it in place, but on a bumpy drive or if a charging cable gets stretched, the charger could pop loose and have to be pushed in again. This didn't happen, but the charger felt loose enough that it could have. We knew that it didn't pop loose, because the white LED light remained on during the drive.If you need four fast charging ports in your vehicle, the Aleratec quad port charger should definitely be considered. I wish they had used a conventional round barrel instead of the rectangular one, but the capability of charging four mobile devices simultaneously partly makes up for the possible inconvenience of having to reseat the charger occasionally.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Charges 4 mobile devices simultaneously - 4 stars","unixReviewTime":1389312000,"reviewTime":"2014-01-10T00:00:00"}

The product details indicate that the weight of the charger is 1.1 ounces, but on my postal scales, it looks like the weight is just under 3 ounces.

The charger can be recharged from a USB port or from an AC wall charger or vehicle charger. I charged it up with a 5V~1.0A wall charger, then used it to top off the charge on my Samsung Android phone. There was enough capacity remaining to boost the charge on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet. With a full charge, the battery charger should have enough capacity to completely recharge any cellphone on the market today, or extend the usable time of any tablet at least a few hours. It's all automatic too; there are no buttons to fiddle with. When the charger is plugged into a mobile device, recharging begins immediately and shuts off when the mobile device has been recharged to 100% or when the charger is depleted, whichever occurs first.Heavy duty users of smartphones and tablets who are away from recharging sources for much of the day will likely need more recharging capacity than this charger has. For many users, however, 3100mAh will be sufficient for their needs, and the small size and weight of the charger will be welcomed. And I have to give kudos to the manufacturer for mentioning that battery chargers have energy losses that reduce the effective capacity by up to 30% of the advertised capacity. Most manufacturers don't mention that fact. 5 Star America claims that their battery charger has an energy conversion rate of 85%, which would yield an actual effective capacity of 2600mAh.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":4.0,"summary":"A remarkably thin portable charger","unixReviewTime":1385942400,"reviewTime":"2013-12-02T00:00:00"}

Pairing was quick, with the Magicbox being recognized as &#34;BIGBox&#34; by my Nexus 7 tablet.

Moreover, the voice was very loud.

The tradeoff for so much capacity is, of course, the size and weight of the charger. Weighing in at about 8 ounces, this is no lightweight, but it's only 3-4 ounces more than some chargers with much less capacity, so it's not a bad tradeoff if you need the capacity and can't afford to lose power during an important phone call or video or GPS run.

(I should note that the phone was not in a case.) It worked as advertised, with the red light glowing when the cable was plugged in, and the blue light coming on when the phone was fully charged.The cable appears to be solidly built. With my wife's two previous iPhones, she used Apple charging cables that came with the phone, and each of the two cables came apart at the plug end well before her 2-year contract was up. For the first one, we bought a new and hugely overpriced Apple charging cable. The next time, we used a third-party cable that cost half as much and was a better cable. As I write this, a 3-foot Apple Lightning charging cable is $19 plus shipping at the Apple store, and it only gets two stars in the Apple reviews. At $10 and free shipping from Amazon, the Zeetron Lightning cable is a much better alternative.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A very well-made Lightning cable","unixReviewTime":1386720000,"reviewTime":"2013-12-11T00:00:00"}

With the strange-looking silicone earbuds and the semi-rigid cable that connects the two headphones, it's a different setup from other headphones that I've tried. But it actually works well once you figure it out. The instructions include a drawing that shows the correct way to wear the headphones. I was a little leery about how securely the earbuds would stay in place, but I moved my head around a good bit, and I couldn't shake the headphones loose.The controls are split between the two sides: The multifunction button (MFB) that turns the unit on and off, plus the next/previous track buttons are on the right side; the volume controls are on the left side. Pairing is done by holding down the MFB until an LED light blinks red and blue.

The maximum volume was loud enough to hurt my ears, so there's no problem hearing music or voice over background noises.My jogging days are over, but I believe the Jogger Pro headphones would stay in place for normal jogging. The most obvious place where sweat or rain could enter the headphones is the charging port, and it's sealed with a rubber flap. Recharging the headphones' internal battery is done with an included USB cable with a nonstandard 2.0mm plug. While the unit is plugged into a USB port, a red LED light indicates that charging is underway. The instructions caution against using an AC adapter that is not Avantree certified.

The answer was &#34;Yes,&#34; and they'll add more information about charging specs to the instruction sheet.My verdict: It's an unconventional design, but the Jogger Pro headphones actually work quite well, and to my ears, the audio quality is excellent. The headphones fold up to a very compact size (about 3&#34;x3&#34;) that fits in a drawstring carrying pouch.

In any case, it's the smallest, lightest portable battery charger that I've personally used. With 3000mAh capacity, even allowing for normal electrical losses in the internal circuitry and cables, the charger should give at least one full recharge for cellphones, and perhaps half of a full charge for most 7\" tablets. That's enough to extend talk time or operating time by several hours. To test the charger, I used my Samsung smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD 7\". With the Kindle Fire, the charge increased from 56% to 88% in seventy-one minutes. Then I connected my phone, which charged from 74% to 100% in sixty-five minutes. These times are comparable to the results I've had with other portable battery chargers. At the end of that time, the battery charger still had enough reserve capacity to top off the charge on my wife's iPhone 4. To recharge the battery charger, I used an old Kindle AC adapter with an output of 5V~0.85A. The manufacturer recommends an input of 5 volts at 1 Amp maximum. Two USB cables with micro-USB plugs are included, but you'll need to use your own AC adapter (or recharge from a USB port on a computer).Like many other portable battery chargers, the EasyAcc U-bright 3000 uses a simple system of four LED lights to indicate its own charge state.

The adapter syncs with audio sources like tablets or cell phones through Bluetooth, then pushes the audio into a speaker system through a standard 3.5mm audio cable. I did that with an old set of speakers that I used with my home computers for several years. It worked perfectly with my Kindle Fire HD tablet.

It's not ideal for someone with a 9&#34; or 10&#34; inch tablet with 3G/4G connection who uses their tablet all day without access to an AC or vehicle charger. That's the tradeoff you get when the charger is small like the LiBa with only 5600mAh capacity. On the other hand, the small size and low weight (4.6 ounces) means it's very portable and hardly noticeable in a backpack or purse.I used the fully charged LiBa to recharge my smartphone, which has a 2200mAh battery. The smartphone was at 40% when I started, and it took 108 minutes to reach 100%. The LiBa still showed 3 LEDs, which meant it still had 50-75% charge. Doing some arithmetic, my phone required 2200 x 60% = about 1320mAh from the LiBa. That would leave the LiBa with about 5600 - 1320 = 4280mAh capacity, which is 76%. So the recharge used about a fourth of the LiBa's capacity, actually a little more if electrical losses in this kind of device are factored in.The output of the LiBa is rated at 5V~1.0A. That's fine for most mobile devices, although the 1A output will take longer to recharge devices that can take up to 2A.

There's an audio cable included for non-Bluetooth audio devices. (The 42&#34; flat cable is very limp, and it appears to be less prone to kinking and tangling.)The headphones are lightweight (5 ounces), and the adjustable headband gave a perfect fit for me. The cushions on the ear pieces have enough padding to be comfortable even after almost an hour on my ears. The headphones fold up into a compact size (about 6&#34;x4&#34;) for storage in a cloth pouch (included).The controls on the right side (volume, pause, advance, and back) are small raised buttons that are easy to feel and operate, which isn't always the case with headphones. To check the Bluetooth range, I walked around the house, and with line of sight, the range was at least 30 feet; with a couple of interior walls of my house between the headphones and the audio source, the signal was still solid with only a few dropouts at about 25-30 feet.I seldom use my Android cellphone, but I paired it with the headphones, and it was fine for hands-free calling, with good volume and clarity. The headphones have a small microphone on the bottom of the right side for phone calls.I charged the headphones' internal battery overnight using an AC adapter with an output of 5V~1.5A, and the included 40&#34; charging cable. The manufacturer states that the speaker will play for up to 8 hours on a full charge.Overall, I'm impressed with the RevJams Xec headphones, with their comfort, excellent audio quality, and reliable Bluetooth connection.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Lightweight and comfortable with first rate audio quality","unixReviewTime":1388793600,"reviewTime":"2014-01-04T00:00:00"}

First of all, the mount adhered to my dashboard very securely, and I doubt it's going anywhere until I decide to take it off. I don't take that for granted, because the first mount I used a couple of years ago was not very secure, and I had to buy a flat plastic mounting pad and cement it to the dashboard. The iClever is also the widest mount that I've seen, holding phones up to 3\" in width, and holding them very securely with padded side grippers and two \"feet\" at the bottom for support. I mounted my Android phone and went for a drive over roads with speed humps, and one local street with some potholes, and the holder kept my phone secure all the way. With two adjusting points - a lockable swivel and a lockable ball joint - the phone can be positioned in virtually any way a driver chooses.The holder should work with almost any phone made today except for the so-called \"phablets,\" which are too wide.

The unconventional design and the dayglo green-on-black colors will draw attention, that's for sure. They actually fit better than I expected, and they seemed to be fairly secure from slipping off, although I don't do vigorous exercise anymore, so I can't say that for sure.The headset paired easily with my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; as device &#34;BLUEVIBE AGL.&#34; The audio sounded good to my ears.

It takes a little practice to learn to use them by feel, but by the end of a six-song playlist, I had it down fairly well.The headset's internal 150mAh battery can be charged from a USB port.

This review is for the black headset with the curved large arm with the word &#34;MPOW&#34; on it.The design of the Mpow Bluetooth headset is akin to the Bluetooth devices that proliferated when cellphones began featuring wireless Bluetooth a number of years ago. I was still working then, and I used an in-ear Bluetooth earphone, which was nice for hands-free calls. Retired now, I seldom use my cellphone, so I haven't used one of these earphones in several years. The Mpow headset is a noticeable step up from the older type that I used then. It's certainly more comfortable, with the arm that has the ear cushions being soft and flexible. Also, the arm can be rotated to use either ear. The kit includes three different interchangeable ear cushions, so most users should find one that's comfortable.I paired the headset with my Samsung (Android) Stratosphere phone to see how well it worked for hands-free dialing. It paired easily as device &#34;Dacom music.&#34; I asked my wife to call me, and after answering the call with my phone's control, I carried on a conversation with the headset. The sound quality was generally good. I tried moving away from my phone to check the range of the device. It was okay for line of sight up to at least 25 feet, but at shorter ranges with two walls between me and my phone, the reception was a bit hit or miss. I don't see this as a problem, since in practice, my phone would be in my jacket pocket or beside me.I also paired the headset with my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; to listen to music wirelessly. It worked fine. Controlling the music with the buttons on the large plastic piece of the headset, a long press on the &#34;-&#34; button advanced the music to the next song on my playlist, a long press on the &#34;+&#34; button returned to the previous track (that's the opposite of the user guide instructions). The sound quality was satisfactory for music. With only one earpiece, you're getting monaural sound, of course, but for using the headset for phone calls, it's dangerous to have both ears covered with earbuds if you're driving at the time. A single earpiece is a reasonable compromise that lets you hear the conversation while still hearing traffic sounds around you.The headset's built-in battery is recharged through a USB port by a USB cable with a mini-USB plug on one end. The charging cable is included, as is a car charger. The car charger is not labeled with the electrical specifications, although the user guide reads &#34;Power adapter output: DC5V 150mA.&#34; The headset kit comes with a nice pouch that everything can be stored in.For listening to music, I prefer stereo earbuds or headsets, but for situations where you need to hear surrounding sounds (such as while driving or listening for a baby's crying), the Mpow headset is ideal.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Not just for cellphones - 4.5 stars","unixReviewTime":1386547200,"reviewTime":"2013-12-09T00:00:00"}

Yes, no more plugging your phone up, just set it on top a \"Qi Wireless Charging Pad\", and let the magic happen.Upon opening the package, there is a little black tag that looks similar to a bandage. After looking at it for a few moments, you can see some very small electronics sandwiched between two stickers, with two gold raised contacts.In order to use this, there are few simple steps that are required. First, remove the back cover to expose the battery, this works best on a table or flat surface. The two gold raised contacts will have to make contact with the contacts above the battery on the left, and that is pretty much it. To hold the tag in place, I find it best to place a piece of clear office tape on the top and bottom. After the tag is place, replace the back cover, set it on a wireless charging pad. Once on the charging pad, wait three to four hours, and your phone will be fully charged.If you are tired of plugging up you phone, and pulling/kicking the cord out of the wall, you will love this.CONTENTS:PowerBot QI Wireless Receiver TagFEATURES:Wireless Charging Standard: QiEffective Charging Range: 0.19in (5mm)Input: DC 5V/1AOutput: DC 5V/500-1000mACharging Time: 3-4 HoursEfficiency: > 70%Weight: 0.17oz (5g)","overall":5.0,"summary":"Makes Charging You Phone A Breeze","unixReviewTime":1393027200,"reviewTime":"2014-02-22T00:00:00"}

The pictures cannot convey how good the Bluetooth headsets are, you have to open the box and find out.Inside the box, besides the awesome headphones, you will find a flat AUX cable and micro USB charging cable. Finding all of these goodies inside was like opening a box of \"Cracker Jacks\".On the headphones there are only two buttons, yes \"There Are Only Two Buttons\". The power button serves as the on/off, paring mode, and phone answer/end. The volume button has only one purpose which is to raise/lower the volume.I know you are wondering, \"How Do You Operate Them\". On the left ear there is a touchpad, similar to the one on a laptop. There are multiple motions for control. The first motion is to swipe up/down to increase/decrease volume. The second motion is to tap the sensor to play/pause the song. Lastly, to advance to next tracks, use two fingers in an opening motion, reverse motion for previous track. I know the use of finger swipes is reserved for phones, but they can be mastered within minutes.Once on the head, the background sounds will be disappear even without music playing. When I first placed them over my ears, it reminded me of the hearing test you take inside of the booth as a kid in grade school that is how quiet they are.They pair just like any other pair of Bluetooth headsets. After pairing, the music was clear and the bass was deep. Even at higher volume, I was able to hear the true sounds as the producer made them.There is a microphone located at the bottom of the left speaker. This microphone allows for clean phone conversations. Next to the mic, is the charging port which is hidden out of sight.The layout of this product has been well planned and thought out. The band over the head is covered in a very supple mix of foam and synthetic leather, which makes for a soft feel on the head, unlike the plastic used on most brands. The earpieces are also covered with the same material as the overhead band, they form to the ear, and can be worn for hours. If you feel they are too big to carry, they can be folded to fit a backpack or purse.The best part of these headphones is the ability to plug the AUX cord into the headphones and turn them into a regularg pair of headphones.Contents:SoundBot Bluetooth HeadsetFlat AUX CableMicro USB Charging CableFEATURES:NFC Pairing: YesBluetooth Version: 3.0, EDR, A2DP, AVRCPOperating Rang: 33ft (10m)Battery Size: 400mAhCharging Time: 3 HoursMusic Playback Time: 14 HoursTalk Time: 12 HoursDriver: 1.73in (40mm)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Listen To You Music Without Wires","unixReviewTime":1395532800,"reviewTime":"2014-03-23T00:00:00"}

The body is constructed of wood, which produces some good music. The face of the speaker is made of acrylic, which gives it nice look. In the hand is nice and light, but feel sturdy. The entire speaker is coated with a textured plastic that gives it a good feel. The size is similar to box of \"Kleenex\".The two pairing modes are Bluetooth or NFC (Near Field Communication). Bluetooth pairs the same as any other Bluetooth device. In order to use the NFC pairing mode, pass the back of your phone near the bottom right hand corner of the speaker screen. NFC pairing is a much faster way to pair than Bluetooth. When playing music the sound quality is great at lower volume levels, but becomes washed out at higher levels.There are three input options, this makes the speaker versatile. The first method is AUX, which allows the speaker to be used as a wired device with supplied 3.55mm cable. The Micro SD slot will play music from a memory card. The USB port is perfect for music stored on a \"Flash Drive\".The speaker has a FM Radio function, I was unsuccessful on using this function, and your mileage might vary. I know it say up to four hours of playback, I have only been able to get two hours. For a speaker this size with two big speakers, I was looking for playback time. The instructions on the user manual were pretty vague and did not make much sense.

Since having this wireless charger, it has made charging much easier. This charging method will take a little more time than a standard wall charger.First, you have to ensure your phone is Qi-Compliant (wireless charging capable). There are three options to choose from: your phone comes with wireless installed; you change your back cover to a wireless cover; or get a wireless receiver tag that goes between the back cover and battery. Once you have your wireless method chosen, plug up the wireless charger and let the magic happen.The body is made of plastic, while the top and bottom have a smooth silicone finish. The silicone allows the phone to stick to the top while the bottom sticks to your table or nightstand. The best feature is how the top can rotate; you no longer have to place your phone on top of the charger to make it work. Now you can turn the top and charge you phone in landscape mode, you can even watch a movie while charging.This wireless charger pairs well with any mobile phone.

The speaker is deceptively small and only measures about 3 inches by 3 inches by 10 inches.Sound: It contains only two active drivers and two passive bass radiators. The size of the drivers are limited by the size of the box and can't be any more than 3\" and in fact they look like they're about 2.5\" speakers. The woofers, well there aren't any; instead there are a couple of passive bass radiators which pretty much means the low frequency sounds are amplified by means of being bounced about inside the box passively. But the bass belies the size of the box. The sound coming from these speakers is rich and powerful and have no right coming from such a small box. I'm very impressed by it.Functionality: Huge battery life (15 hours) max, can be paired with 2 bluetooth devices at the same time and can remember 8 devices in memory.Value: At the current cost you can get a couple of pretty decent speakers but this isn't about getting a couple of wired speakers that connect to your A/V receiver.

In cost, this is towards the higher end of the spectrum for this type of device, but it's also the best sounding one I've ever heard.Summary: Deceptively small for its sound quality.

You can plug the handset directly into your mobile device if you want, bypassing the stand.The stand is very high quality, it's made of a heavy metal alloy. The handset is made of a matt plastic and the non-slip pad on the stand is  made of silicone. The packaging of this product also contains quite a bit of the silicone.It's really easy to use, it's just basically a mic and a small speaker in the shape of a handset. I plugged it into both an Android and an iPhone and both worked well and without having to use any adapters, however the handset does not have volume control. The cord is not overly long so you can't move around that much when it's plugged into the stand. There are 2 tiny flanges on the non-slip pad which helps prevent your mobile device from slipping, but only if its bottom edges are square.One of the main selling points of this would be the stated 99% reduction in radiation. Also, it would be great for people who like using a traditional handset for tele-conversations.Overall, it's a pretty neat device for those who like to have their phone on a stand and a traditional handset.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Very nice","unixReviewTime":1353369600,"reviewTime":"2012-11-20T00:00:00"}

I travel a bit and when you are out of the house, an external battery is a necessity. I received this a sample for review. This 81600mAh battery is one of the most powerful I've ever seen and it's compact (the smallest I've seen for this capacity) and inexpensive.It has 2 slots (1A and 2.1A) so you charge 2 devices at once, a tablet sized one and a phone sized one. 81600mAh means huge capacity. On a 7 day travel, I did not manage to use it up at all. This would be great for a family traveling with a lot of devices. I only wonder if they could fit more than 2 ports on it.It comes with a nice mesh travel bag and a USB charging cable.So to summarize: A large capacity external battery that is not only compact but inexpensive. A winner all the way around.---------------This is a large extended battery for the Galaxy SIII. It fits on the back of your phone but because of the size of it you need to use the included case extension. Both the case and the battery fits on snugly.Before use, I charged the battery to its full capacity. I used a charger and just left it on the wall for about a day. I'm not sure of time as I charged it in the morning and just removed it at night.For a moderately used phone, the battery lasted 4-5 days. The charge is pretty incredible. In the first one or two days, I kept looking at the phone seeing that there was still juice in the battery when a normal battery would have long needed another charge.I highly recommend this battery for those going on trips or day trips. For someone going on a long hike or camping this would be excellent.Disclaimer: I received a sample from the manufacturer for the purposes of review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Excellent!","unixReviewTime":1378166400,"reviewTime":"2013-09-03T00:00:00"}

Jabra's packaging of their products always look good and is no different in this case.The TAG can be charged by USB or the included wall charger. Charging takes a bit less than 2 hours. Bluetooth pairing is easy and is done by pressing the multi-purpose button 4 seconds. Neither of my devices that I tried (iPod and smartphone) required a password.Instructions are poor. Neither the online pdf manual or supplied paper manual explained full usage of the unit, including what the colors of the LED meant. The online page indicated that there was a supplied USB charging cable which was not included.FM Radio: Minimalist design means no display so you just have to scan up and down to find your station and wait for an announcement to know what station you're at. The signal strength was strong for me and reception loud and clear.Earbuds: Fair, though they worked well enough, I didn't like their design. It's a matter of personal taste, but fortunately you can unplug the Jabra earbuds and put in your own.TAG: Very light and minimalistic. You can hang this around your neck or clip it to your collar. I'm not a fan of the minimalistic design and buttons that have more than one function without labels, but with trial and error you can pretty much figure everything out.Summary: Basically this is a wireless set of earbuds and controls that work with your phone or other bluetooth device. It includes a FM radio which in most cases will be redundant. It does everything it's supposed to do. I deducted 1 star because the earbuds weren't to my taste personally (I will use my own) and I didn't fancy the minimalist design. I think they should have put a small LCD display for the radio so you can at least see what station you're at.------------Update: November 2013.

Not only that, but with up to 6 devices when we travel, a high capacity external battery is necessary.This is an 10000mAh battery, the highest I've used to date. Note however that Julian from Maxboost says in one of the comments that all high quality battery chargers have a 30% energy conversion loss and the net power available is 7000mAh, which is in line with my experience.The charger itself is quite compact for its power and very well designed. It's mono-colored with an LCD readout showing the power left/used in percentages. This is great because most batteries only have lights or colors to show usage but this is more precise. There are two outputs, a 2.1A for larger devices and 1.0A for smaller ones (such as phones).The battery works as well as expected. We've used this to charge iPads, iPods, e-readers and all different kinds of phones and have no problems. Using it to recharge 3 phones during a day out, we weren't able to exhaust the charger so we're very pleased with that. But using it to recharge an iPad will use up most of its charge. Still, I would expect this charger to be able to charge an iPad and one phone several times from one whole charge.The battery also comes with a small LED light, activated by pressing the button twice. It's not very strong and some of the light leaks out through one of the USB ports!One of the best things I like about this charger is that the charging cable comes with inter-changeable heads. It has the mini USB, micro USB and Apple iPod head so you can charge devices need those heads. The carrying pouch is another nice inclusion to prevent the battery from getting scratched.Bottom line, this is a high capacity battery charger at a very decent price. On long day trips or traveling, I would recommend the highest capacity charger possible and this would be a good choice.Note: Sample was provided for review. Though this was only a sample, I have to agree with what some of the AVP reviewers say, Julian at Maxboost is very helpful with any questions and customer service is great.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Excellent!","unixReviewTime":1390780800,"reviewTime":"2014-01-27T00:00:00"}

It feels good in the hand and is easy to carry around. Because it's all round and there are no edges, you can slip this in your bag or in a cubbyhole in you car, etc. for carrying around and for placement.The biggest reason why I give this 5 stars is its versatility. I've reviewed many such speakers but none I have is as versatile as this. You can play music from:a) USB drive from its USB slot.b) SD card from its SD slot.c) FM radio from its built in FM tuner.d) Any audio device with a 3.5mm jack.e) Any bluetooth compatible device.It's basically a radio and speakers for every single device I have. As a bonus, it has an earphone jack and a mic so you can answer phone calls on it.The speakers come with a 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable and battery. The battery is detachable so I guess you can change it with a fresh one for more playing time as you shouldn't charge and play at the same time.It's easy to charge, just plug in the cable and the red LED will show. I found FM radio reception to be strong and clear. Sound quality is fair for this price and the size of these speakers, they are only 2W each. At home, listening to the radio on a quiet day, they were perfect for me.A couple of things that I miss is a wheel for volume control and a simple LCD screen but I don't often see them because manufacturers are trying to bring the price point down. You can get better sound with bigger speakers and a bigger box, but this appears to be a perfect compromise for speakers of this size and price.Overall, I have to give this product the highest marks for size, design, portability and versatility at this price.

The matt texture on the back is very pleasing. I like the bevelled edges; it makes it easy to pick up off the table. The screen is bright and the colors are vivid. I also like it that all the buttons are on one side, it makes it neat and tidy and harder to press a button by mistake when picking up the phone.Camera: Quality of the camera/pictures is excellent. The flash is unbelievably strong and can light up all corners of a dark room. I like that there is a camera button on the side instead of just something on the screen like other smart phones. There are a multitude of photo-editing apps available.Windows8: The operating system is the biggie here as it is the interface between you and the phone. I'm not a great fan of Microsoft forcing Windows8 on desktops or laptops but it's great for mobile devices. It's easy and quick to learn and easy to customize. One thing I love is the return button. If you click something by mistake, you can simply hit the return button and go back, with Apple products you have to go home and then click the app again. Another thing I like is the search button, no need to find the app to search; the bad thing is that the search engine is Bing!The browser is fast and I can load up image/content heavy websites fast. Actually the whole phone is fast.Battery: Hard to say so far. It's supposed to be good, but I've been using the phone almost non-stop playing games and it's lasting less than a whole day. I like the charge port is at the top, seems more convenient that way. Unfortunately, you cannot remove the permanent battery for a fresh one. This means I will have to keep a charging cord with me while out and playing marathon games. But at least it doesn't use some kind of proprietary cable.Phone: Call quality is fine. This phone will be a good choice for Verizon customers.Apps: Migrating over from Apple products, some of the apps I use like Snapchat, Instagram, etc. are missing but that's the price of Windows. It was a long process to download the initial app because you have to go through a tedious initial set up. Update: There are some complaints about the lack of apps but I'm starting to find a lot of apps now, including an app that gives you Google. And I really like Nokia's Map Here which is even available offline.Overall very satisfied with it. The important things are that it's very fast and the operating system easy to learn. I give it 9/10, the 1 pt deduction being the permanent battery and on Amazon's 5 star rating system, that is still 5 stars.Update 1: The phone has also survived it's first drop on the floor.Update 2: 5 mins ago, the phone was dropped again by the same culprit, this time on its corner.

Goode \"JBG\"","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"I was glad to have the opportunity to try this for the iPhone4 because it's hard not to scratch your phone since it goes everywhere and is subject to a lot of wear and tear.The application. First of all, it was extremely easy to apply. I did it while waiting to be seated at a restaurant.1) I completely wiped down the face with the supplied wet wipe. The wet wipe took care of any oils but there were some wipe marks left.2) I used the supplied microfiber cloth to clean off the wipe marks until the face was completely free of any marks or oils.3) Removed the clear plastic film marked (1) from the shield, centered it on the phone and placed it on.4) Tapped the shield lightly in the middle and it applied itself squeezing out all the air.5) Removed the blue plastic film marked (2) and used the supplied squeegee to press it down.6) That's it. Because the shield is rigid, it is much easier to apply than protective film. You don't really have to worry about air bubbles or creases in film. But I have to say you should have a steady hand because I would not want to reapply it if it goes on crooked the first time.Function:1) Because it's a rigid shield with a thickness of 0.4mm, it does add thickness to your phone. However it also made the phone more rigid. The whole phone feels more solid. I was also able to fit on the phone's protective case without any problems.2) Protection. Passed the test with flying colors. We tried to scratch it all through dinner with the utensils on the table and none could scratch it. Felt good about that. The shield should also help the phone face from breaking because it's an extra layer on top of it.3) Doesn't reduce touch sensitivity.Overall, there are more pros than cons. The pros are that it's easy to apply and the shield is tempered glass with all its inherent toughness. The con is that it adds a little thickness to your phone. I think that the durability and the toughness of the glass trumps plastic film.If you want a durable and tough shield for your phone then I would highly recommend considering this. I received a sample from the manufacturer to try and I'm glad I did because I would not have considered a glass face until I tried this one.Addendum iPhone5:I also received a sample for the iPhone5 from Zeetron to test and because the page won't allow me to post a review for the iPhone5 I'm adding it to the bottom here.1) Application is the same as above. Very easy to apply.2) Protection:a) I decided to put it to the test and tried all manner of sharp objects to scratch it. I ran screwdrivers, scissors, nail clippers, box cutters, nails and keys across the front and failed to scratch it. I'm very impressed with this. The sharp points basically just slid off the glass. This should definitely stand any normal abuse.b) I also tried to smudge it. The shield is supposed to have some kind of oleophobic coating, and again it works. The shield failed to smudge.Overall, very pleased with it's protective qualities. If you tend to be very hard on your phone, I would definitely recommend this. Put it on a brand new phone and it will stay new. Highly recommended.Final update:With repeated scraping from a knife, shiv, machete, axe and a Swiss Army knife we were finally able to put some small scratches on the face plate.

The design of this charger is amazing. All of the other ones I've seen have all been functional. This one looks like it's been designed by a bona fide design company and not a bunch of engineers.Even the box it comes in has a neat fold out lid. Inside, the battery is secured in its own felt bag. The bag has two compartments, one for the battery and one for the charging cable. But wait! Underneath, there is a drawstring bag of goodies. Apparently Ledow feels that the Moonstone battery isn't enough, they also included some gifts. I don't know what others got, but gifts included a plastic key, a double sided suction pad, a fish skeleton, a small 2.0 USB drive, a 24k gold sticker, a small necklace, a tiny stylus and 6 button stickers. By the way, I received this as a review sample, but it's no different from a regular Moonstone battery.Alright, all the cute stuff aside, how does this battery work? It has 2 USB outlets, one at 1.2A and one at 2.1A. Both can be used simultaneously. The higher powered one can be used to charge tablets and the smaller one phones.Per the specs, this battery has a 90% conversion rate which is better than the 75% ones I've seen (which means more of the stored power is usable). It also uses a lithium-polymer battery which is better than the Li-ion ones. It also prevents over charging, over discharging and over heating.I usually think of batteries as functional devices, necessary when your phone runs out of juice, but this company has taken it up a notch. Not only does this battery work good, it looks great! Two thumbs up for this and highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"summary":"Amazing!","unixReviewTime":1397692800,"reviewTime":"2014-04-17T00:00:00"}

This one is for my Galaxy S4. The kit comes with a charging pad and a receiver. First, I opened the back of my phone and stuck the receiver on the battery. The instructions are not the greatest in the world but I found and peeled off the sticky pad on the back of that. The charging pad is even simpler. Just plug the USB cable in and it turns green. Put the phone on it and it turns blue. According to the instruction sheet, the pad has smart chips and you can leave the pad plugged to the charger on long term stand by without problems. I got this free of change in exchange for testing it out and writing a review here.  Nevertheless, these things are so convenient, just put the phone on the pad for charging.

What's the one thing that's happened most in our extended family? Dropping the phone into the toilet. That's happened 3 times before so we simulated it by dropping it into a full sink and picked it back up. We also held the phone case under water for a few minutes, shook it and banged it around the sides.Verdict: The inside of the case stays dry by virtue of a band of dry silicone that compresses and seals the two parts of the case when it's closed up.Thoughts as per the description above: \"Adopts IP66 international Standard, which is dust proof and waterproof for daily life, but it is not suitable for diving.\" And I'm going to agree with that. When buying a case like this, I'm going to assume that most people are not going to be taking their phones diving with them. Rather, they want something which will stand accidental immersion. It's just physics, a band of silicone like this will prevent water leakage up to a degree since it's a physical barrier which compresses and seals. But if you subject it to prolonged pressure, it will leak. My first draft is below, basically I said it was perfect for outdoor activities. Now after testing, I know it will stand a drop in the toilet/sink as well.--------------------This is a very nice water proof case. It is a black plastic material that feels pretty tough. The case fits perfectly for the iPhone 5c but is loose on the iPhone 5 or iPhone 5s. I received this as a review sample. It works just like it should.It protects from running water (holding the case under the tap). All of the buttons are easy to press except for turning my ringer on/off but I don't usually use that so it isn't a very big problem for me and pressing the home button. You have to use a little extra force with the home button, or you can stick on a home button sticker to make it stand out more.The biggest problem I have with the case is that it's a bit hard to take off but with a little bit of practice you could probably take it off easily. To make sure the case is secure, there are 6 snap on flaps along the sides. I used a small screwdriver tip to snap them off to save my fingernails.A thing I like is that there is a loop at the top of the case that you can loop a string at the top. The screen protector doesn't distort the screen either.Overall this is a nice water proof and rugged case that protects against water and drops. This is the perfect type of case I'd use for hiking, biking and other outdoor sports. It will withstand drops and rain and such abuse a phone would get in the outdoors. At the current price, I'd definitely  recommend it to a friend.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Nice!","unixReviewTime":1397865600,"reviewTime":"2014-04-19T00:00:00"}

So how did the Discover 665 compare to the 925?  In general, it worked well, with easy pairing and one-touch answering.  Where it lagged, however, was in audio quality. I could hear him, but he couldn't always hear me, and occasionally his transmission had some vibrato and/or muffling.  While the problem could have been with my 925, I've used it for years without such issues.

I can shake my head and jump up and down with the earpiece facing the ground; it NEVER falls out.  The device is a breeze to pair since it automatically searches for available Bluetooth devices as soon as you turn it on.

First, the price is much more reasonable; rather than costing close to $100, it falls within the range of the more affordable BlueTooth sets.  Another improvement has to do with the included charging case:  there is now a small, flexible, plastic piece that helps the user guide the earpiece into the micro-USB plug, making it less likely to snap.  Although I never had a problem with my original case, I really appreciate this added feature in my new one.  And last, the range seems to be improved somewhat, although that may be device-specific.  Note:  I got a new Plantronics as a supplement to my original one because the old one stopped holding a charge as long as it did originally, after 2.5 years of regular use.  The old one still works, however.The Plantronics Discovery 925 is designed to look cool -- as cool something stuck in your ear *can* look. You have probably seen it in the ear of the computer geek character in NCIS: Los Angeles as well as in those of several characters in movies and television.  (Nice product placement, Plantronics!)  But a cool-looking BlueTooth is useless if you can't stand the way it works or feels.  I find that the silicone anchor, which rests against the relatively flat area behind the canal, to be much more comfortable than models that hook around the ear.  While at first I thought it wouldn't stay put, it does.  Beautifully.  I can shake my head and jump up and down with the earpiece facing the ground; it NEVER falls out. You position the microphone toward your mouth, along your jaw.  My iPhone 4 has no trouble recognizing voice commands coming from the device, and since that software relies completely on generic voice recognition (instead of recognizing my individual voice), I figure the reproduction must be excellent.  My husband can't tell that I'm using the BlueTooth, either, and so it passes the human test as well.  The only drawback is the wind sounds it picks up outside, but that's an issue with many such devices that have sensitive microphones.The device is a breeze to pair since it automatically searches for available Bluetooth devices as soon as you turn it on.

He has thick fingers, and he did not have the accuracy he needed -- until I got him this. The rubberized tip keeps the stylus from sliding across the screen.  Yes, it does leave little circles and crescents on the surface; however, they can usually be wiped off, just like fingerprints.  But, hey, he can now use his iPhone without the initial frustration.The stylus feels like one from a PDA:  light, thin, and pretty small.  I found it tiring after a while to grip because of its narrow width.  I could \"flick\" the screen with it, although I much prefer using my finger, and typing on the virtual keypad was easier and more accurate than with a finger (fewer errors - but thank God for Apple's word correction software!). The \"flick\" was slower and slightly more difficult to execute with the stylus, but it was doable.  Still, I much prefer using my finger.  The only thing this cannot do it is the zoom in and zoom out features since that requires two fingers.  This device is designed for those who, for whatever reason, find that they cannot enjoy the iPhone's features without a more accurate tool.  Hint:  Give yourself a couple of weeks of adjusting to the touchscreen before you decide this.  It does take time.Because the iPhone doesn't have any place to store a stylus, you may find yourself misplacing yours.  Once you've tested this and liked it, I recommend buying spares.

The Amazon Basics case adds a tiny cleaning cloth, one screen protector (forget the plural in the product name), and a squeegee for application of the protector.PLEASE NOTE:  Amazon has combined product reviews for different Amazon Basics cases, some with screen protectors and some without. Also, different colors share the same reviews.  Customers should check the descriptions to see which version they are ordering.The Case: Four StarsFirst, the pros:  it has textured bars on the side for firm gripping; the case slips on easily; the cut-out for the rear camera is two-tiered, which protects the lens without casting a shadow over it; the silicone minimizes the possibility of the phone slipping out of your hand; controls are easy to reach; it's inexpensive and unobtrusive.The cons:  the case doesn't fit tightly; as I pull it out of my handbag pocket, the sides can get caught and can open up, thus becoming a lint catcher; the circular cut out in the back to display the Apple logo is unnecessary and perhaps will catch its share of dirt.The Screen Protector: Three StarsI've never used a screen protector for either one of my iPhones, but I figured that, since one came with the case, I'd give it a try.  Now I'm not so sure.  Make sure you use the squeegee (a small plastic tab) to apply.Pros:  it adds a protective layer over the \"gorilla glass\"; it does not impede the touch operation of the phone.Cons: you have to get the plastic lined up perfectly the first time; no matter how careful I was, I couldn't avoid two small areas with bubbles that I still can't get out; the iPhone glass is easier to get clean than the plastic protector surface; the sharp lines around the phone openings look and feel, well, less elegant than the original.If you really want a screen protector, then I'm sure this is as good as any other, but I have never had a problem with scratching either my 3G or my iPhone.Recommendation:  I would get this for the case and not the screen protector, unless you're going to buy a protector anyway.

I could hear cars approaching, which is a good thing for outdoor activities but not so great when you don't want to hear the treadmill or the TV across the room. When I first opened the package, I was skeptical that the sound quality would be good because the rubber covers have only a small opening at the bottom.  The cover is not flush with the earbuds, which means that the sound is funneled through the small opening instead of fully into your ears, the way in-ear sets work. And the covers are one-size only, so I was sure that my smaller ears would cause problems.  Not to worry! The resulting sound is not muffled, although not intense. either.  In other words, the sound is perfect for workouts or casual use, but not for dedicated listening.

They are comfortable to wear for long periods.There's a sliding volume control on the cord.  While the volume range is small, it's great for subtle adjustments when you can't easily get to your MP3 player/iPod.Next, the bad:  The most disappointing part of this Jabra set is the failure of the control box to work as an iPhone device.  You are supposed to tap it once to answer your phone, twice to skip tracks, and three times to \"rewind.\"  When I click it, all it does it give a momentary burst of sound (this is NOT the volume control, either), no matter how many times I tap it.  It never answers my iPhone 4, even though the sound (ringing and voice, once manually answered) does get channeled into the ear buds.  As a hands-free iPhone device, it is close to useless.  Also, sometimes when I remove the ear buds, one or both gel covers stay in my ears.  This is annoying, especially if I don't realize it right away.  Yes, the gel covers are that comfortable that I can walk around with one in my ear and not notice right away.If you want high sound quality, noise-isolating ear buds, I recommend one of the Ultimate Ears models.

The battery holds about 2 1/2 full iPhone 5 charges, with a minimum efficiency rate of 70%.  The new iPad takes a lot more juice than an iPhone, so you won't get a full charge out of the Astro.

It has blue lighted dots on the top to show you how much power remains, a useful feature if you want to charge a device but don't want to use up everything you have.  It comes with a USB charging cord (but no wall outlet plug -- you supply that yourself if you want to charge it more quickly); adaptors for micro-USB, mini-USB, and traditional -- not lightning -- Apple connections; and a soft mesh pouch for holding everything.  If you want to charge an iPhone 5 or, say, a camera with a proprietary connector, you have to supply your own USB cables.  The battery has an LED flashlight on one end that provides a focused, close-up beam; in my opinion, this is strictly an emergency light for dimly illuminating a small area -- a nice feature but nothing exciting.

At the time, only the most expensive (and nearly indestructible) Otterbox and a few other cases were available.  The KaysCase was one of the few reasonably priced, low-profile cases available.  I bought this semi-soft case based on reviews and with the idea that the clear sides would not detract from the elegance of a black iPhone.Because the edges are semi-soft (that is, they are flexible without being rubbery), the iPhone fits with minimal effort.  You just have to bend the edges outward slightly, slip the phone inside, and let go.  It fits almost perfectly; there is just a tiny area, about the width of a pencil line, that covers one of the speakers.  The rest matches the design.  I can easily silence, use the volume buttons, sync/charge, or lock it with the case in place.  The space around the headphone jack is large enough to plug in earbuds or an auxiliary jack.

Otherwise, you risk ripping the case at the bottom.If the clear back had arrived without any marks, this would be a five-star product; however, mine arrived with visible scuffs on the inside that appears as though they were made during part of the manufacturing process.

The back, all sides, and the edges of the screen are protected by a thin, rubberized plastic.  The lock and volume buttons are covered.  I like that the lip wraps around the edges of the screen to protect in from edge impact and to lift the screen, just a little, in case of face down impact.

It protects the back and part of the sides from scratches, but it offers no impact protection, in part because it doesn't have a raised rim to keep the screen from touching the ground if it falls face down.  The white plastic does not wrap all the way around the sides of the phone, so I think it would look better with the white iPhone than it does with my black one.  On the black model, too much black is exposed, and it makes the white plastic parts that grasp the phone look cheap.If you're looking for a way to decorate your white iPhone 5, and not to give it impact protection, this may be the case for you.

The other two arrived with minor scuffing that cannot be seen against the gray aluminum of the iPhone 5 back.  If these odds hold against all buyers, each has a one in three chance of receiving a marred product.  Since returns and exchanges can take time and effort, potential buyers should consider whether they are willing to either put up with initial scuffing or exchange until they get an acceptable one.  Of course, as with all transparent back screens, these will get scuffed over time, depending on how they are used.  Still, it bothers me that the manufacturer cannot deliver these in pristine condition.  (The same thing happened to me with an Amazon Basics transparent case.)  But I love the look!Second, because the cutouts on the case are so precise, unlike early iPhone 5 cases that had to have wide exposed areas because companies didn't have the exact specs, the headphone jack can be too small for some headphones and audio cables.  I cannot play my iPhone in my car using the auxiliary cable while the phone is in the View case because the connection has a wide base and cannot be inserted fully.  All the headphones/earbuds I own fit fine, including a Sennheiser noise cancellation set.  If you use a wider base jack on a regular basis, you will likely be disappointed.  Since I rarely plug my iPhone into my car using the jack, I consider it only a minor drawback.  Obviously, others will think differently.Despite the drawbacks, I do like the cases.  A lot.  The iPhone 5 snaps in easily, and it is held firmly in place.  Removal takes a bit more effort, but it's not difficult at all.  The case covers the lock and volume buttons, but leaves the rest exposed with the precise cutouts.  Yes, it takes a little more effort to lock the screen with a covered button; however, the difference is not significant. The mute button and rear camera slots are large enough, yet still protective.  Out of all the Belkin cases, the View seems to have the highest raised lip to protect the screen if the phone falls face down.  My favorite Belkin case is theBelkin Grip Candy Sheer Case, but that case has a slightly lower rim around the screen.All colors should look equally good with the black and the white models of the iPhone 5, although the white may show more of the imperfections.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","overall":4.0,"summary":"I really like the Belkin View Case -- despite some potential issues","unixReviewTime":1359158400,"reviewTime":"2013-01-26T00:00:00"}

The color designs are great, but the overall design of the product is disappointing.  For one, the rigid plastic makes it a real struggle to get the phone in and out.  For this reason, owners aren't likely to swap one case for another on a whim to change the look of their phone.  Next, both of the Blooms cases look best with the white iPhone.  I own the black phone, and even though I could see the white plastic in the photos, I thought I'd like the contrast.  While the back of my phone looks great, the front looks like it is gripped by cheap white claws.  This is due in part to the non-protectice nature of the cover.  It covers only part of the sides, and it doesn't provide a rim around the screen.  It simply covers the back and holds the phone in by a plastic death grip on the two sides and corners.I have two of these Blooms covers, in both colors.  I prefer the \"blue\" one, although it's more of a gray-blue than the photo shows.  The purple one is also cute, with its purple and silver polka dot flowers.  The plastic is glossy, with a back cut out (trimmed in black) for the camera.If have a white phone and don't care much about impact protection, then this series may be what you're looking for.  The case is more like a skin -- that is, more decorative than protective -- and it will protect the back and part of the sides from scratching.  All buttons and their surrounding areas are exposed.

Unlike many basic cases, these Friendly Swede cases wrap around the screen edges to give a little more protection.  There is enough of a lip that if I dropped my phone on its face, I have a prayer of picking it up with the screen intact.  Yeah, it's not an Otterbox, but it is soooo much more elegant in my hand.  The bubble colored set doesn't fit the phone as well (no overlapping lips), but offers much more in terms of colors and value.  Note:  Multiple Friendly Swede products are being put in the same review group, so make sure you read the reviews relevant to the set you are considering buying.Out of the three floral designs, I like the pink and white one best because it evokes Asian art.  The pink, white, blue, and green one is more Victorian-looking, and the black background with butterflies, while looking great with my black iPhone, is more cutesy.  I like that I can choose my cover with my mood since these cases are so easy to remove and install.  Five stars.Out of the bubble colors, I can't decide which I like best.  The colors are lighter and more transparent than the iPhone 5 set photo shows.  You'll get orange, lime green, red, magenta, yellow, clear, smoke gray, purple, and bright blue.  Because the protection isn't quite as good as the floral set, I give the bubble semi-transparent set four stars.The hot pink stylus that comes with the floral set has a nice feel to it.  Although it requires a bit more pressure than some others, it is incredibly responsive and accurate.  I haven't (and won't) use the screen protector because I already have a glass one installed on my phone.These are really nice, simple cases that add a distinctive design to the back of your phone, giving it personality.

Yes, they don't offer the protection of the upper-end Belkin cases or the Otterbox series, but they are sold at a different price point. These protect the back, sides, home and lock buttons, and even a little of the screen with a rubberized rim in case the phone falls flat. Besides the price, the nicest part of these cases is how they allow the iPhone 5 to remain small while still protecting it. The rubber texture (silicone?) resists a bit when going in and out of my pocket but not so much to be annoying. And I really like that I can switch cases from purple to pink and back to purple, depending on my mood, without a lot of effort. Both look good on my black iPhone, although the pink pops more because of the contrast. The purple is more of a stealth color because it's so dark.The one small drawback (and it is minor, in my opinion) is that the silicone over the home button requires a little more pressure than if it were uncovered.

If you bought this for a brand new phone, the cleaning will be easier than if you try to apply this on a screen that has been exposed for a while.  Never fear, though.  It can be done.  Just be patient and meticulous before you try to apply the film.The application of screen protectors is always a little tricky, and, while this Belkin kind is no exception, my experience was a lot much positive than with the AmazonBasics and the Scotch brands I tried before this, both of which I discarded in frustration.  With this one, I was able to get all the bubbles out fairly quickly, and, except for one corner where my case caught it, the protector is lying perfectly flat.  (The thickerCommando Screen Protectoris even easier, although the thickness in that brand can cause some issues with tight fitting cases.)  The good news is that these come three in a pack, so it's not too much of a deal if you have to turn to a second film.  TheBelkin Anti-Smudge Screen Protectorsis equal to this one in ease of application, although I decided I didn't like the matte finish and so switched to this one.  I'm sure you can tell by now that I'm pretty picky with my screen protectors.The only adverse effect I've noticed with this protector is the way it picks up fingerprints and smudges; it seems worse than having the bare glass.

It is easy to install (no bubbles!), and it seems durable enough to last a long time.  Of course, the smudge-free finish has its cost:  clarity.  The matte finish causes some blurring on the retina display, and for many, that will be a deal-breaker.  The matte finish creates a little more resistance and a bit of sound when swiping than you'd get with the bare screen or even one with a transparent, glossy protector. I got used to the feel fairly quickly.  The swiping sound took a little longer.When the iPhone screen is dark, this screen protector looks very cool.  It gives it a look similar to that of the aluminum back.  But I'm going to switch to the Belkin transparent protectors because the fuzziness when the screen is illuminated drives me crazy.  For me, smudges aren't such a big issue that I'm willing to sacrifice the sharpness of the retina display.

For an iPad or similar device, which take a lot more power, you'd be better off with an 8400mAh capacity battery.  When my iPhone 5 registered 6% or 8% battery life remaining, I was able to charge the phone three times without recharging the Yubi.  Yubi claims at least 88% efficiency with the battery, delivering at least 4576 mAh with loss, and given my experience, that figure seems to be accurate.  Other brands have a much higher attrition rate, thus giving you less power for the same size external battery.  Anker, for example, has a 30% power attrition rate on a similarly sized battery.The battery comes with a short (6\") USB cable and adapters (micro-USB, mini-USB, PSP, and standard Apple.)  If you have a different, proprietary connection, such as the lightning connection for iPhone 5 or one for a camera, then you can use those USB cables in place of the supplied ones.  The battery does not come with a wall charger.  While you can technically use your own wall plug, the included USB cable is ridiculously short, and the battery will dangle off the floor.

This information is linked to an individual code on the back of the case and is available to anyone who scans it. The app, free in the iTunes store, allows you to set up separate business and social media profiles as well as a \"lost\" setting that you can set up to display your email address, alternate phone number (home or business -- obviously not the phone itself), and any other information such as a reward for its return.So why only three stars?  Well, this is the most elementary of rigid slide cases, the kind that sells for $10-$15 dollars, depending on the brand.  It offers minimal protection to the back and sides, with the top and bottom completely open except for the corners.  You are paying for the individual QR code and the storage of your information.  That could be worth it, especially if you like simple snap-on cases and the app were more versatile.  The problem is that the only people likely to have the Findables app on their phones are those who have a Findables case.  If someone without the app scans the phone using a regular QR code reader, they get an email that they must then open to get the contact info.  The process is multi-step.  If you think you will mostly transfer basic contact information, it would be easier to use an app like Bump.  Where Findables excels, however, is when you want to give someone your social media contacts in Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, etc.  Here's where the Findables app gets really good:  you can specify different profiles for business and social networks.  That means that you can share your LinkedIn profile information on the business setting profile, but Twitter and Facebook only on your social network setting profile.  The only drawback is that all social media information for each profile is sent when scanned.  For instance, if your app is set to social, anyone scanning your code will get all the links you add.  You cannot specify just Facebook, for instance, if you've also linked to Twitter.Perhaps the most potentially useful part of the app is the lost phone contact information.  That part of the app relies on people seeing the QR code and actually scanning it; I doubt anyone finding my phone will pay attention to it, although, certainly, it's possible.  For the lost setting to work, you must log into the app using your credentials, and set it to \"lost\" mode.  Keeping it in lost mode also prevents people from scanning the code to gain access to your social networks and business profile.  When you want to share either social or business information, you must log into your account and change the settings -- and remember to put it back to \"lost\" when you're done.  It would be great if the app defaulted to lost whenever the app was closed.  Still, even if you don't do that, there isn't much of security risk since a person must be on top of your phone to scan it.  If someone undesirable has your case close enough to do that, you've got other things to worry about.Maybe Findables will come out with better cases in the future, and if they do, I might find it more attractive.

The hum doesn't correspond to the voices, either mine or the person on the other end, but instead seems random, sometimes in long notes, others in short pulses.  As a waterproof case, this case still deserves 5 stars, but as an everyday case, only 3 stars.  My original review follows:---As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, I have a real need to protect my iPhone.  I have tried other products designed to waterproof my iPhone 5, and they have had been nothing more than glorified vinyl bags.  This Lifeproof fre is the only one that looks and acts like a regular case while giving the phone extra protection.  For that, I love it.  The Lifeproof case is relatively easy to get on and off, and it keeps the phone slender and lightweight.  You wouldn't guess the amount of protection it gives just by looking at it.The case comes in two parts, top and bottom, and it comes with an headphone jack adapter to use earbuds/headphones while still keeping the case watertight.  The adapter has an extra headphone jack cover in the holder.  You must test the case, following the instructions, to make sure it is watertight before putting your phone inside.  The test also serves as a trial run for how to use the case since there are several ways you can go wrong.  First, the seal must be perfect all the way around; you have to press all the way around to get both pieces flush so the interior O-ring can work.  Also, the headphone jack needs to be screwed in, and the tab covering the lightning port snapped shut.  Any mistakes in the preceding will result in a non-waterproof case.  Once you realize what must be done, you can tell at a glance whether the case is properly installed.The white case makes my black iPhone look like a white one because of the way the top screen mimics the actual look of the phone.  Inside the case, the phone looks like it's inside an ordinary, low-profile case.  The thin top screen is almost as sensitive as the iPhone itself; I have no problem swiping, texting, and selecting apps.  I've asked people halfway through phone conversations if they notice any sound problems, and they have been surprised that I asked.  I can hear calls, ringtones, and music perfectly.  If there's muting, it's subtle.  The only weird part is that the sound vibrates the back of the case, and that was disconcerting at first.  Although the user must remove the headphone jack screw to use earbuds, I don't find that a problem since I rarely use the headphone jack.  If you want a waterproof case, you're going to have to deal with some variation of this issue since there's no way to connect headphones directly into the phone while maintaining the integrity of a watertight seal.There are only two minor aspects that I don't like about the case.  One, the Lifeproof screen does not sit flush with the phone at the top because of a interior disk, and that results in slight rainbow touch marks on the screen.  The other problem is the exterior access to the mute button.  Unlike the button on the phone, the Lifeproof mute button is not a switch.  You push it up and down the way you would operate the real one, but there's no visible way to tell whether your phone is already on mute.  I find myself switching it on and off and looking at the screen to see whether my phone is silenced or not.---Customer support is non-existent.  I submitted a tech support ticket, received confirmation of its receipt, and then heard nothing.  It has been over a week since I tried to contact LifeProof.I was thrilled with this case because it's better than anything else I've come across.  I love that I can slip my phone in my pocket and not worry about being caught in the rain.  I can take it with me to the beach or in a boat or hiking or to a theme park with water rides -- and I don't have to worry about destroying my phone in the process.  If you often use the headphone jack on your phone, I'd recommend getting this case only as a specific-occasion use and having another for every day.  I just cannot stand the hum in my ear.  I plan to use this only in outdoor circumstances when I might expect the phone to get wet and not for every day as I was previously using it.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","overall":4.0,"summary":"I Thought I Loved This Case, Until . . .

You must lay the clear back piece on the phone, slide the top piece into place, and snap on the smaller bottom piece.  You must take care that the bottom piece is snapped into place or else the case will fall apart without warning.  The first time I put on this case, I had to push harder than I expected.  (You'll know that the case is properly installed when there's only the barest crack between top and bottom pieces.)  Once the case is assembled correctly, it will not come apart.  In fact, at first I couldn't figure out how to get the case off again.  (I pulled out one side of the bottom piece, and the case then came apart easily.)  The feel in the hand is smooth, but, of course, that means that it could slip easily out of your hand.  It slides into a pocket with no effort at all.Considering that many clear-backed cases arrive with scratches already marring them, I really appreciated Spigen's use of a peel-off cover on the inside of theirs; however, it still arrived with marks.  I have yet to receive a clear-backed case that was scratch-free, although this case was better than most.  It comes with both a slate (my preference) and a gold-toned bottom.  The included screen protector is a little thicker than most others, and for that reason, applies more easily than most.

It also resists scratches and dings from fingernails.  Once in place, the button does not slide.  It does take a little bit of effort to remove, but once I got a bit of fingernail under the disk, the whole thing lifted off without leaving behind any residue.These are marketed in part as a \"protection\" for the home button, although I question how much that's really needed.  They raise the button area, making the button slightly easier to find without looking than the iPhone's recessed home button.  Again, I'm not sure how many people need one for that reason.  To me, the real reason for purchasing these is to personalize the look of the iPhone, something many people, particularly teenagers and young adults, like.  If you coupled, say, the pink one with a pink or otherwise matching case, then the iPhone would feel uniquely yours.  Because these are stickers, don't expect to change the colors frequently  They aren't meant to be used as a daily fashion choice since their stickiness will be compromised by multiple uses.  Still, when I returned the one I took off to its spot on the packaging card, it stayed put, so the stickiness lasts longer than your usual paper/plastic kind of stickers.These would make a great stocking stuffer for someone who likes to jazz up his/her phone.

As a result, the external battery market has exploded with lots of (sometimes confusing) choices.  On one hand, this iFlash power bank joins the pack with a sleek, easy-to-use battery.  But on the other, it does much better than others because it comes with all the extras that others don't always include:  a USB cable, a selection of adapters for various devices, a travel/storage pouch, and -- this is rare -- a USB outlet adapter to plug into the wall.  When I travel, I can just stuff the pouch with its contents into my bag.Like many other external batteries, the iFlash has LED lights to display the amount of battery charge remaining and a built-in, but not very strong, LED flashlight.  (The flashlight turns out with a double-click on the power button.)  The battery is rectangular, with a glossy black top/bottom and a white plastic, no-slip band on three of the edges.  It is charged via micro USB connection, and it distributes its charge via USB-to-whichever kind of port you want.  Although it comes with a range of adapters, you can use your own cable specific to your device.  For example, it doesn't come with a lightning adapter, so I just use my iPhone 5's lighting cable by plugging it into the battery's USB port.This size will charge my iPhone 5 a little more than twice, and it gives my iPad about a 35-40% charge.  This size is obviously more appropriate for smart phones than tablets, simply because the charge isn't enough to give more power-hungry devices all the juice they need; however, it is powerful enough to transfer power to them, saving them from blinking out on me.  If you want a power bank to use primarily with a tablet, I recommend getting at least 8400 mAh, although you'll also have the added weight of a bigger battery.  External power banks always have an attrition rate when transferring power, so it's not as simple as \"doing the math\" to determine the correct capacity for your needs.  Most batteries have a 30% attrition rate (that is, the battery eats up 30% of its charge in the process of transferring power to another device), but that isn't usually achieved until the battery has been completely drained and recharged several times.  I've found that the fourth time usually reaches the maximum amount the battery will transfer.

Still, I need to protect my phone.  This Spigen case is a fantastic example of a case that can look almost naked, subtly two-toned, or distinctive, depending on which model you choose.  I love mine; however, because I have two Slim Armor cases, one (gunmetal) that fits and works perfect and one (metal slate) that doesn't fit right, quality control may be an issue; read on for details.First, make no mistake:  this is not a heavy-duty case designed to encase your phone in thick rubber and plastic.  It makes the iPhone only slightly thicker while protecting the back, sides, and buttons.  There are adequate cut-outs for camera, speakers, control, and cables with button covers for the volume control that somehow work despite going through the removable backplate and the main frame.  The gunmetal color provides a subtle contrast between the black of the main case and the matte gray of the plate.  In most light, the contrast is slightly more evident than it is in the product photo.The case is easy to slip on and off, and the plate is easy to swap in and out to change the color of your case without changing the actual case.  (You can buy replacement backplates in a variety of colors.)  I like this exchangeable backplate design because I can change the look of my phone in mere seconds.This would have been a five-star product if I had only the gunmetal case.  Or it would have been a one-star product if I had only the metal slate version.  When I inserted my iPhone 5 into the metal slate case, it didn't fit properly.  No matter what I did, one side of the screen didn't fully fit and was slightly lifted, making the glass vulnerable on the edge.  I decided to pop my phone into the other case to see whether the bad fit was a design flaw or a defect.  It immediately became clear that the problem was a manufacturing defect of millimeters.  If you decide to buy this case and if it doesn't fit right or if the buttons aren't properly aligned, exchange for a new one.  This case can and should fit perfectly.I really love this case on my black iPhone 5 for its elegance,  If you are looking for maximum protection, however, look elsewhere.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","overall":4.0,"summary":"Low-Profile Protection with Changeable Backplate","unixReviewTime":1366934400,"reviewTime":"2013-04-26T00:00:00"}

It's huge -- I guess to make it universal -- and my iPhone 5 looks small inside, but that also means I have a little room for money and an ID.  The best part is that I can use my phone without removing it from the pouch since the plastic does not prevent capacitive contact.  I can swipe, call, check email, etc. without taking it out of the pouch.Of course, I didn't want to test this on my iPhone in case it didn't work.  I folded up a square of tissue paper, inserted it, flipped the latches closed, and submerged it in water for a hour.  Since tissue paper picks up water easily, I expected to see a few drops through the window.  There was nothing, not a drop.  The only time it got wet was when I opened the latches and pulled it out.  The paper brushed against the water that had collected around the opening.  If you do get wet while wearing this around your neck, take a lot of care when opening the pouch and removing your phone.I was surprised by how large this is:  4\" x 7 3/4\".  The top/latch portion is 1/2 \" thick when closed.

As others have noted, there's a small gap between the phone and the rubberized back of the dock.  I don't detect any stress on the phone's connection -- when connected, it seems fully stable -- but the back will prevent the lightning connection from being snapped off from backward pressure.This dock is a simple idea that could have been better implemented for people who use thicker and/or more protective cases than those that have open bottoms.

Although it adds length, especially at the bottom, width, and weight, none of them are bad enough to be deal-breakers.  I've seen Otterbox cases that were more bulky than this.  The uNu Power DX keeps my iPhone up and running for twice as long.The fit is perfect, and the lightning connector goes into the phone smoothly and firmly.  The top and bottom sections meet without noticeable gaps -- other than a thin seam, of course.  Because the case charges using a microUSB connection, you don't need an extra lightning cable when you go on the road, although you do need to remember a microUSB cable, the kind that charges Kindles, Bluetooth headsets, and many other electronics.  The camera cut-away is both deep for protection and angled away for unobstructed shots.  The speakers have open slots.  If you have earphones/headphones that use  a right-angle connection, then you can use the included adapter.A small design issue is the on/off button.  I like to have my battery case charged but not charging my phone so that I can use it in case of emergency.

Many times I've been in an airport looking for an outlet to charge up, but other people have tethered themselves to all the available ones.  This is where an external battery comes in handy.  This Yubi Power Bank is solid, sleek, and has the added benefit of being able to charge two USB devices at the same time.All external batteries have a power attrition rate that is much less than the stated capacity of the battery.  Most brands are about 67-70% efficient when converting the internal charge to an external device.  The material that comes with this Power Bank claims a 8400mAh capacity with an efficiency of \"more than 88%.\"  If this refers to the power conversion efficiency, it would mean that the battery should supply at least 7392 mAh of power.  My iPad has a 11,666 mAh battery, which means I should expect the battery to be charged 63% when depleting this battery.  Instead, the best I got (with the iPad turned off to eliminate the possibility of usage during charging) was a 53% charge after six charges/discharges.  (It took five cycles for the battery to reach its maximum charge, with a 2% charge gain for each of the previous four charges.) This indicates a 73% maximum power conversion efficiency.  While this efficiency is certainly better than many, if not most, of its competitors, buyers should not expect a full 88% from the Power Bank.  Of course, it beats being stuck somewhere without power, and the battery still holds a decent amount of power.  You should get four full iPhone 5 charges out of one battery cycle.One downside to this battery is the length of the supplied charging cable.  It's about six inches long, which means that I cannot use my own USB wall charger because the power pack would still be dangling in the air.  Given the weight, it would disconnect.  If I use the supplied cable, I'm limited to using the USB port on my iMac to charge it or to plugging it into a floor power pack/surge protector.  When I'm in a hotel, however, neither of these options are available to me.  A 10\" cable would be much better.  I also would have liked a travel pouch like the one Anker provides with their batteries to keep everything together, although, that's a minor wish.The Power Bank a nice external battery that allows me to charge both my husband's and my iPhones at the same time.

I like that I have have my driver's license, a few credit cards, money, and my phone all at the ready to be pulled from my back pocket with a single tug.It took me a while to find the best configuration for credit cards and money since folded bills stashed with the credit cards caused the cards to spill out occasionally when I extracted the phone wallet from my pocket.  I learned to put the cards in the magnetized pocket and the bills in the small flap at the back.  Or, since the flap can only hold one card, I can put my driver's license there and the money in the magnetized section when I don't need credit cards.  (American bills must be folded in thirds or quarters to fit within the width of the wallet.)  The credit cards stay within the magnetized wallet as long as I don't knock it or hold it upside down for a while.  For this reason, I don't have complete faith that I won't lose anything from it.  The manufacturer could improve this by extending the elastic at the base to slightly around the corner.  Even a small area would help keep the cards in place.  Anything wider than a standard credit card will stick out and therefore be prone to falling out.I haven't owned this long enough to notice any quality issues, and so far, everything has held up to in-and-out-of-pocket use.

I can stick the battery in my purse with its charging cable to have it available wherever I go.  Most other external batteries are more bulky; therefore, I take them with me only when I'm traveling.  This iFlash power bank simply slips in one of the inner phone pockets in my handbag.  Even better, I like that I can get more than one iPhone 5 charge out of it even though the specs say only one full charge.It takes about two hours for the battery to charge my iPhone 5 (lightning cable/adapter not included), about 30 minutes longer than if I plugged it into an outlet -- not bad at all.  I like the push button display of how much charge is remaining (in 25% increments.)  There's also a pull-out micro USB cable built into the side for charging devices with that kind of connection; for this reason, the battery is ideal for smartphones that use micro-USB.

It has improved over the last version (which I also own) by making it more narrow overall but also by adding clear side panels for visual access to the side.  The first version fit more tightly around my iPhone 5; this one is both looser (the phone isn't always straight) and slightly better looking.  The top clasps work the same way as the old version.  It's not always easy to align the tabs to close the case, but once closer, the pouch is watertight.  The clear plastic allows you to operate the phone while it's inside, and sound gets through surprisingly well.The pouch comes with a black lanyard to wear the phone around your neck.  Before using mine, I tested it by placing a piece of tissue paper inside and submerging the case for an hour.  Don't use it without first testing it for leaks!  I find that water can collect inside the latch area, so if the pouch goes underwater, make sure you dry the outside thoroughly and open the top upside down, shaking any collected water out before you remove your phone.  I can't operate the side buttons on my iPhone 5 through the clear panels, so, for me, they are more aesthetic than practical.This case is best suited for occasional use -- a day at the beach or pool, for example, or when an outdoor day calls for rain.  If you are frequently in dirty or wet conditions, splurge for a waterproof case made to fit your specific phone and that looks more like an everyday case.  More customized waterproof cases usually cost a lot more than this one, however, making this an excellent value.

With an 88% efficiency rating, the power bank gives me roughly 2.5+ charges on my iPhone 5 or a partial charge (a little over half) on my 3rd generation iPad. (Buyers should know that power banks rated at 5400 mAh -- or any mAh, for that matter -- don't give all that power since some is lost in the charging and power transfer.) This Sendy power bank comes with a short cable, a carrying pouch, and several adapters for various devices. If you have an iPhone 5, you'll have to supply your own lightning cable. It charges using microUSB and outputs power via USB, so that means you can substitute a longer microUSB cable for charging or any USB-ended cable for specific devices not covered in the adapters.My iPhone 5 charges fairly rapidly with this power bank, not as fast as if I had it plugged into an outlet but still not bad. The iPad is a different story since it requires a lot more juice; it takes several hours just to get all the power out of the bank. The Sendy is a 5 V power pack, and iPads, to get the fastest charge, need a 10 V connection. Still, the Sendy works, albeit slowly. If I'm running low on my iPad battery, I can plug in the Sendy, and it keeps me running. If I'm using power-hungry iPad apps, however, the battery level will drop a little, even with the Sendy plugged in. The drain is slower than it would be otherwise, of course. If you're looking primarily for an extra power source for an iPad, I recommend looking at a greater capacity battery and, if you can find one, a faster charge transfer.The build quality of the Sendy seems solid. I like the design of the blue semi-circle of LED lights on its face to show the current power level. Most power banks have some variation on this feature, but I found this to be one of the more attractive displays. The on/off button is located in the center of the semi-circle. This can double as an LED flashlight by double-clicking the power button. Again, this feature is found on different brands of power banks, and it's something that can come in handy in an emergency. (Imagine being in a hotel room when the power goes off.) I wouldn't expect to use the flashlight when camping or other outdoors-at-night activities since the beam isn't all that bright as it travels away from the source.This power bank has found a spot in my briefcase. An external battery is an important tool for the frequent traveler or anyone else who chews through smartphone batteries.

Hotels, in particular, are stingy with open outlets.  This Bolse high output charger solves part of this problem by having two USB ports, a 1.0 A port and a 2.1 A port for more power-hungry devices.  This means that I can charge my iPhone and my iPad out of the same outlet plug and at the same time.  Because the plug is not polarized, I can plug in one of these with the ports pointing down and another with them pointing up to enable charging four devices out of a standard two-plug outlet: iPhone, iPad, camera, and Kindle, for example.The prongs fold into the body for a sleek travel shape; however, the moveable prongs also mean that sometimes I fold the prongs into the body when I'm trying to plug them into an outlet.  Not a big deal for me.  The body is a glossy white or a glossy black plastic and feels extremely sturdy.  It handles 100-240 volts AC current, so it can be used in many different countries as long as I have a travel adapter. (No power converter necessary, only the adapter.)  A blue light illuminates when power is flowing through the charger so I can tell easily if I haven't plugged it in all the way, something that's extremely important when I'm also using an international adapter.  The charger measures 2 6/8\" long by 1 1/4\" wide by 1 1/4\" deep (without prongs extended), making it extremely portable.This device is a must-have for frequent travelers like me; however, it is also useful in the home or to take to the office.

Like its larger cousin, the ECOXBT, the ECOROX is a completely waterproof Bluetooth speaker that can go anywhere -- the beach, the pool, the shower, or on a hiking trip. Once you charge it fully, the battery will last for 9-10 hours of music: if you take an external power bank with you to recharge it, you could probably get several days worth of playing without have to plug it into an outlet. The size (roughly 5\" x 3\" x2.5\") makes it the perfect size to stash in a backpack or beach bag. I love that I can keep my iPhone or iPad a safe distance from water and still have sound coming through the speaker right next to water. Even better, I can play music through my iMac and carrying the speaker outside. The Bluetooth range, while not as extensive as a speaker run through a wireless network, is better than average. The volume is powerful. The sound is good, not great, but still much better than might be expected from a small waterproof speaker.When I'm connected via my iPhone, I can answer an incoming call using the call button, just as I could with a Bluetooth headset. I cannot start a call, however, and I cannot call up Siri. Button on the top of the speaker allow me to skip to the next track and adjust the volume. It's a little annoying to hear the high-pitched beeps when the speaker is making its Bluetooth connection, and there's a static click when I stop the music for longer than ten seconds.To keep the unit waterproof, you must take care that the back rubber panel is completely flush with the unit. I could tell from the moment I opened the box that this a rugged speaker. The rubberized ridge on the side make it easy to grip and offer impact protection if you drop it. The grilles (the colored parts) are thick, rigid, and dent-resistant. The rubberized controls have a nice feel.The unit charges through an included microUSB to USB cable. The manufacturer also included a carabiner clip to hook it to a backpack or other handle. A threaded-screw mount on the bottom enables attachment to a speaker stand, tripod, or anything else with a universal mounting screw. I have the red model, and I like that it's a dark red, not too bright but colorful enough to find easily in a bag.As a portable, weatherproof, waterproof speaker, this ECOROX excels. It combines a small size with powerful sound and rugged construction.

I had tried a similar Belkin dock and was disappointed that the lightning connection was too short to use with the phone in a case.  Unfortunately, the same is true with the VicTsing.  Even with a case with a wide cutout in the base, the lighting connection does not fully make contact with the port.  No contact, no charging.  The only case that worked for me was completely cut out in the bottom with not even a rim of plastic or silicone.  VicTsing, like Belkin, could solve the problem with a longer connection and, for bare iPhones, an adapter to raise them as though they were in a case.  Or they could otherwise allow the user to adjust the height.But on a bare iPhone 5, the dock works perfectly.  There is no support behind it, however, and the connection has free play, so my phone wiggled back and forth while I was trying to plug it in or disconnect it.  I suppose the semi-floating connection makes sure that the lightning connection doesn't snap off since there's is a gap behind the phone.The blue, lighted pen holder looks cool, although its function is questionable.

Although this wall charger is designed for travel, you have to manually attach the prongs or leave them attached, which in either case doesn't make for a compact package. I'd much rather have the prongs fold into the body. And if I'm going to have four ports, I'd like to be able to charge four devices at full speed. Other wall chargers that I own have at least one 2.1 amp port for charging an iPad, and this remains constant, no matter how many other devices are attached. Not so with the Etronic Quad Port.I tested this with four devices -- iPad, iPhone, iPod, and Kindle -- all of which had 50% or less battery charge remaining. To mimic what I would do in a hotel room, I plugged them in using the Etronic Quad port before going to bed and unplugged them first thing in the morning. All four had full charges by morning. The sticking point, however, was the iPad, which displayed \"not charging\" after a few minutes of being plugged in. Still, it continued to charge. This also happens when I plug the IPad into certain USB hub ports because there isn't enough power running through them. It charges, but at a very slow rate. Using the Etronics with the iPad and other devices at the same time was the equivalent of using a low-powered USB port on my computer.This wall charger is okay if you won't include a tablet in your four devices or if you'll always use it overnight. In fact, it's quite convenient to be able to charge four devices from one power source.

That said, the Amplim Alloy does not offer high-impact protection.  The plastic rises as high as the screen only on the two, long sides, and it doesn't have a pronounced lip to keep the screen from hitting the ground when dropped face down.

It takes about 7 hours to charge the battery using a wall adapter.The dual ports are great to have.  When I'm on vacation, I can charge both my iPhone 5 (with my own cable) and my camera at the same time.  This battery will charge anything that can get power through a USB cable, although, if the included connectors/adapters don't fit, you'll have to use your own cable.

The balance is nice, with both lower and upper ranges clear and without undue emphasis.  I can adjust the volume; skip or go back to a track; answer, reject, or make a voice recognition activated call -- all with a press of a button on the headset.  Best of all, these headphones sound much more expensive than their retail price would suggest.The only potential problem with these is the fit, and, as I mentioned above, this took some trial-and-error positioning for me to find a comfortable position.  This is the kind of headphone that is worn looped over the ears and across the back of the head or neck.  That took some getting used to.  I found that when I wear glasses, sunglasses or regular, there isn't room on top of my ears to keep both securely in place.  Because the bar can stick out behind my head/neck, I find that the best, most secure positioning is to rotate the earphones a little so that the bar rests against my lower neck.  The bad part about this positioning is that, if I look up, the headphones move.  Fortunately, that isn't something I do often while listening to music.  Still, I took off a half-star for the awkwardness of not being able to adjust the length of the bar for a better fit.These headphones fold up to roughly a 5&#34; x 4&#34; size.  They fit easily into the included rigid, zippered case.  A short charging cable is also included, and it fits into a side pocket inside the case.  The Bluetooth range is about average; I could walk about 24 feet from the source, with a wall in between, before the signal started dropping.These headphones are a great value, especially if you don't mind the over-the-ear, back-of-the-head style.

All I had to do was apply a home button decal (this is a must, or else the shield won't properly attach), remove the first layer of film, line up the shield with the edges, and tap the shield.  The screen protector attaches itself in a matter of seconds, and it's actually fun to watch it progress across the surface.  If a bubble or two remain, you can use the included squeegee to get rid of them.  When the shield is completely attached, you remove the second film, and voil&agrave;!  You have a crystal clear screen protector that looks as good as the iPhone 5 glass screen.  Even better, I find that the Bionic Shield is easier to wipe clean than the Belkin protector I was using, and it also doesn't seem to pick up dirt/grease at the same rate, thanks (I suppose) to the oleophobic coating.  I had forgotten how beautiful the iPhone screen could be.  And because the Bionic Shield sits a little within the lip of the iPhone, I can use it with any case I own.If you mess up the shield application -- it's difficult to get it wrong, but more on that later -- you can pull it off and reposition it as long as you don't remove the second film and take care not to touch the phone screen and the bottom of the Bionic Shield.  Because it's a thin layer of glass, it won't bend, buckle, or stick to itself the way other protectors can.  How do I know this?  Well, I'm one of the rare people who managed to screw up the initial application by not applying the home button.  I thought that because the two included buttons (one black and one silver) were called \"decorative\" that they were also optional.  When I tapped the screen, everything attached but the bottom, so I knew right away the mistake I had made.  With the help of my daughter since I needed extra hands, I removed the shield, applied the new home button, re-aligned the shield, and tapped.  This time, the screen attached itself completely.  I had one tiny bubble that disappeared with a single push of the squeegee.The Bionic Shield and my iPhone have been knocking about in my handbag -- against coins and keys -- without a single scratch.  There's a YouTube video that shows multiple attempts to scratch it, to no avail, and while I'm not about to try the same tests on my phone, I believe them.  Basically, the Bionic Shield is a second glass screen that protects the first.  Since iPhone 5s (and other models) are known for cracked faces on impact, the Bionic Shield is a great way to protect my investment.  I cannot praise the product highly enough.

With dimensions roughly the size of my palm and less than an inch thick, the shiny case looks as sleek as it is functional.  It comes in a grey felt pouch that secures with an elastic band that matches the color of the battery.  When I took this out of my bag yesterday, I drew the attention of the people around me.  Few batteries get those kind of inquisitive looks.Of course, looks don't matter unless the battery performs.  The Moonstone has an energy efficiency rate (how much power can be transferred and not lost) that falls in the middle of the pack for power banks that I've tested.  It has two USB ports, one for 2 A charging (iPads), and a microUSB charging port.  The white, ribbon-style microUSB cable can be used to charge the battery and to charge microUSB devices.  You'll have to supply your own cable for any device that charges using anything other than microUSB.My lime green battery came with a bag containing various fun, though not necessarily useful, gifts:  a red rubber fish skeleton for wrapping cords, a microSD card reader, a yellow suction cup rectangle to use as a phone holder, a mini stylus, a cute screen cleaner about the size of a half dollar, a key-shaped headset wrap, a gold-plated mini sticker, and a set of six home buttons.When considering which size of Moonstone to buy, first evaluate how you expect to use it.  If you want an extra emergency charge, with some left over, to your cell phone, get the smaller capacity one.  This 6000 mAh size is best for multiple smart phone charges or giving a partial charge to your iPad or similar device.I'm of the opinion that anyone who uses portable electronic devices on a regular basis -- cell phones, tablets, eReaders, digital cameras, etc. -- should own an external battery as an emergency power source.  Power banks are especially useful when traveling, spending time outdoors, or during extended power outages.  This Lepow Moonstone is a sleek, eye-catching, and ably-performing option.

The headphones have to stay in place whether I'm running, jumping, or lunging, and they have to provide good enough sound to block out distractions.  And I would like to be able to answer my iPhone if necessary.  These Brightech Active2 headphones mostly fit my criteria.Because the cable linking the two sides of the headphones is worn looped over the ears and worn behind the head, just putting them on can take some getting used to, especially since the angled in-ear pieces seem impossibly oriented.  But once on, they mostly stay put, and that's not only due to the angled earpieces but also to the lightweight build.  My biggest issue with these is keeping the cables looped over my ears.  They won't stay, maybe because I have small ears or because my hair knocks them loose.  This Brightech Bluetooth headset is not the only back-of-the-head set that I have difficulty keeping on; I'm beginning to think that manufacturers don't keep women's smaller ears and heads in mind when they design their products.The sound is pretty good.  I listened to one track that has a singer whispering in the left ear, and it's was clear as could be.  Vocals, bass, and treble are clear, although sound lacks dimension.  They don't have the kind of quality that makes you stop and listen, but then again, the price doesn't pretend that they can go there.  These sound plenty good enough for a workout or just listening to when I'm moving about the house and yard.Besides the loops that keep falling off my ears, the other thing I'm not wild about is the look.  The headphones look a little chunky, although I understand that they need to be big enough to contain the receiver/transmitter.  Bluetooth range is adequate when I use my iPhone, about 20 feet.  With my 3rd generation iPad, it is much better at 30 feet or so.  The build-quality is so-so.  I can't talk about longevity since I've had mine for only a few weeks, but the buttons and body feel cheap.

This Tylt external battery case piggybacks my iPhone with an extra, slender battery while protecting my phone.  Yes, it's bulky, but I don't have to fish around in my handbag or briefcase for an external battery and its cables.  Everything is right there, in one package, and all I need to do is press a button to begin charging my phone.  The main drawback of this case is its inability to charge the iPhone while the case is being charged.It shouldn't be a surprise to learn that attaching an extra battery to your phone adds length, depth, and weight to what is otherwise a slender phone.  But it can be disconcerting at first.  (I have had several battery cases for my different models of iPhones over the years, so I didn't have to adapt this time around.  The first time took some adjustment, however.)  This case gives my phone a full charge with a little left over.  As with most battery cases, you have two choices about how you want to use it:  as a constant (until it is depleted) charging case or as an emergency.  I prefer to use it as an emergency case, which means that I want it switched off until I choose to use it.  This ensures that the case has a full charge at the end of the day if I don't need the battery; otherwise, you'll have to charge the case at the end of the day.  To turn it off, you need to press down the button on the back until the charge display on the phone disappears.  I wish this had a dedicated on/off switch that I could keep in the off position, especially since inserting the phone automatically turns it on.The case charges via micro-USB.  It has a lightning adapter in the base, so all you need to do is slide your phone into the base and then slide the top portion of the case into place.  The mute and volume buttons are a little difficult to reach.  I find my index finger will work, although I imagine that people with bigger fingers might struggle more.  I found that my phone didn't charge while the case was charging, and this is a huge drawback.  Most cases will charge the phone first, then the external battery, all without my having to do anything.But you don't just get power.  You get protection as well.  I once dropped an iPhone 4 with a Mophie case on a concrete walkway on a hill, and I watched how it bounced.  It protected my phone completely, with dings and scratches on the case but not the phone.  This Tylt case should have the same kind of protection because it is built similarly.  Naturally, accidents happen, and your phone might land in such a way that it smashes; still, all corners, the back, the top, the bottom and even a little bit of the screen (the case has a lip) are protected.The biggest disadvantage of this case -- and it's a huge deal for me -- is that it will not charge the iPhone while the case itself is being charged.  At first, this might not seem like a big deal; however, it quickly becomes one.  The only way you can have both devices fully charged when you begin the day is to charge both separately overnight.  That requires removing the iPhone from the case and plugging in two USB cables, a real pain especially if you're traveling.  Of course, you could just charge the Tylt, but what good is that if you have approximately the same amount of power but in a heavier, bulkier case?  I own another battery case, theuNu Power DX External Protective Battery Case, and it charges both at the same time, giving priority to the phone itself.  Other brands that I've used for the iPhone 4 such as Mophie and Splash also charge both with one cable.Despite what I consider a major design oversight, this Tylt case is still a solidly built case that provides much needed power.  If you find that you run down your phone during the day and don't mind the extra bulk/weight, then you should consider this Tylt -- but only if it's considerably less expensive than other brands.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","overall":4.0,"summary":"Convenient Charging On the Go -- But Not at Home (4- stars)","unixReviewTime":1382918400,"reviewTime":"2013-10-28T00:00:00"}

This AmazonBasics case combines a silicone case that wraps around the edges of the screen and absorbs some shock, and a semi-rigid plastic snap-on case that protects adds additional protection and shock absorption on the back and sides.  The harder plastic part of the case also protects the phone from uneven pressure that might cause the phone to flex and therefore break.  The combination of the two makes this case both highly affordable and more protective than most cases under $15.Like an Otterbox, this case requires steps to assemble and disassemble.  You must first slip on the silicone (soft) part of the case, making sure that the rubberized lip covers all edges.  You then snap the already-encased phone into the rigid part.  Once inside, the phone's lock and volume buttons are completely covered, with raised \"buttons\" on the case to activate them.  The other components are exposed through cut-outs.  The cut-outs in both case parts line up well.  The silicone lip provides a slight cushion for cases when the phone is dropped face-down.I own this case in both orange/navy and light blue/gray.  The orange one looks better with my black iPhone 5, mostly because the navy is so dark that it looks almost black.

If I were (more) hard of hearing, these would frustrate me, but because I'm not and because I don't like to blast music, these headphones are great.They are lightweight enough to wear for hours, and the adjustable headpiece ensures that I get a fit that keeps them in place. The sound quality is not bass-heavy, although it picks up the lower ranges nicely, giving the sound a balanced quality that headphones built specifically for rock often lack.

Despite this, the sound -- instrumental and vocal -- is clear. These are definitely more comfortable and more noise-isolating than the P311 -- as I write this, there's a vacuum running in the next room, and I can't hear it.

This Patuoxun Ultra-Slim is best when I need something to charge multiple devices, particularly if one of those devices is my iPad and I want to keep my bag as narrow as possible.  I have two other 1000mAh external batteries, but their shape is chunkier and more compact.  This slender battery is great for tucking in narrow spaces.  It measures roughly 6\" x 2 3/4\" x 3/8\".The Patuoxum power bank gives my 3rd generation iPad a 45% charge using the 2.1 amp port.  (The first charge transferred only 43%, but batteries often don't reach their maximum capacity until depleted and charged three or so times.) This power transfer efficiency rate is below average for a battery of this size.  I have another 10000mAh power bank that gives my iPad a 60% charge and another that gives it a 68% charge.  My tests are always conducted on a powered down iPad with less than a 20% charge; I rely on the percentage-charged display on the device for my measurements.Just because the power attrition rate is not-so-great, that doesn't mean the Patuoxun is a bad choice.  Potential buyers should compare both price and intended storage areas.  For example, if your briefcase/travel bag can't take more bulk in terms of width, then this is a great option since it spreads the cell over a greater surface area to achieve that slim fit.  I also like that I can plug in two USB charging cables at once, one power-hungry (2.1 amp) and one less so (1 amp.)

Once I turn it over, however, I cringe. The back is covered with black type, lots of black warning icons, a garish 5 Star America logo, contact information for the company, and a plea to leave a 5-star review on Amazon. Now, perhaps because I received a sample for review I got extra type. But even if I removed that type, the back would still be ugly and would still detract from an otherwise gorgeous design.

I can slip it into my handbag's cell phone pocket along with my iPhone 5. The lightweight factor comes from plastic construction instead of the metal that many manufacturers use.

It took almost an entire day to get my battery from completely discharged to fully charged, even after four full cycles.  I tried different cables and methods (wall outlet USB and computer USB) in case the fault was in the transfer means.  It still took all day.

For those new to external batteries, know this:  the total capacity of a battery -- in this case, 6800 mAh -- does not give your device that much power because there is loss in the energy transfer between the battery and the device.  An industry average seems to be about a 30% attrition rate or 70% power transferred.  Some batteries under perform, and others, like this Avantree, do better.  It gives a five-star performance for energy efficiency.This Avantree comes in a lightweight white plastic case with a lime green, on-board USB-to-microUSB cable that can be used both for charging the power pack and for transferring power to a microUSB device.

It charges with a mini (not a micro) USB port, and has an on/off switch to conserve battery life.  On the top, there are phone answering, forward, back, and pause buttons.  As expected, pairing is easy as long as you know to look for BIGBox on your list of Bluetooth devices.  (Since I have paired many Bluetooth devices to my phone and iPad, I would have appreciated a more readily identifiable name such as MagicBox.)The sound is pretty good, although not great.  At lower volumes, music sounds a little airy, but increased volume levels produce much higher quality sound, suggesting that this would appeal to those who like to crank up their music, especially since it is balanced toward the bass.  Even so, you shouldn't expect to shake the floor -- this is, after all, a small box designed for small spaces.  And you shouldn't expect high audio quality given its size and the single box format.  It's perfect, however, for a dorm room, small bedroom, office, hotel room, or anywhere space is at a premium.  The only thing I don't like about this -- and it's a feature found on most of its competitors -- is the loud, Bluetooth beep when it is turned on, ready to pair, or in the process of pairing.  The jarring sound ruins the experience for me because I'm anticipating my music, not a piercing beep.  Still, especially since everyone seems to do it, it's a small quibble.Given the price and size, the MagicBox seems ideal for a child's or teen's bedroom as well as for anyone who wants better sound for their smart phone, MP3 device, or tablet.

These slim cases come in a set of five colors to satisfy people who like to change their look or who want to protect several different phones.  Even better, these cases have a feature that I've never seen in a basic case -- flaps that cover the lightning charger and the headphone jack ports.  That feature alone earns these cases fives stars compared to similar brands.The backs of all are hard, transparent plastic to display the Apple logo and the phone color.  That helps the cases blend with both gray/black and white models.  The band around the edges is flexible enough, without being rubbery, to insert the phone and keep it there.  The cases come in yellow/green, pink, light blue, smoke gray, and clear -- something for everyone.  Because the flaps look like they can be torn off, I recommend inserting the bottom of the phone before pulling the top corners in place.  I like that the cases are smooth and sleek enough to slip my phone in my pocket, but also tacky enough on the bands to hold onto.

Yes, the solar power panel is not as efficient as charging it via wall outlet or computer, but I was able to get a 1/4 charge in a few hours of direct sunlight, something that could be a lifesaver for a camper or hiker or anyone in the midst of a long power outage.  With 5000 mAh of battery power, this has the ability to fully charge smart phones at least twice, depending on the phone.  (Note:  power attrition rates lower the actual available power for all external batteries.  This one will charge my iPhone 5 with its 1440 mAh battery about two times, with a little power left over.)My main concern with this battery -- and it doesn't limit the performance -- is the claim that it's waterproof.  When I charge the battery in the summer sun, the plastic case buckles in the heat, and it separates on one side.  It is impossible to snap the case together.  When it cools, however, the case once again fits in place.  The problem is that there is nothing between the case and the inner workings of the battery.  The electronics are exposed as soon as the case is compromised.  Even when the case seems to be tightly connected, I can see little gaps where water could get in.  I would say that this battery may be somewhat water resistant, but not waterproof.  If you are looking for an external battery to take, say, whitewater rafting, you may not be able to depend on it.  Otherwise, this is a fine battery.This charger comes with a carabiner-style clip (make sure the rubberized oval is securely back in place in the oval after you attach the clip), a short micro-USB to USB cable, and an old-style Apple adapter.  The battery can be charged via USB or, in an emergency, partially charged in the sun.  If you have a newer Apple lightning cable device, you'll have to supply your own charging cable.This external power bank is a great choice for emergency power as long as you don't count on it to be waterproof.

This tiny keychain cable is a lifesaver, even if it's not perfect.  It's small enough to fit on my keychain or in a pocket inside my handbag or briefcase so that it's always there when I need it.  I like that I can pull the cable through the body to lengthen it on one end or the other, depending on where I need the most clearance.While the Zeetron emergency cable is useful, it does have some drawbacks.  The USB end doesn't have the typical enclosure to help guide it into a USB slot; the electronics are completely exposed once you remove it from the fob.  Also, the lightning cable connection is a bit tight on my iPhone.

I even thought, Oh, just another Bluetooth speaker.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  First, the sound is really good for a single speaker device.  You can crank up the volume and still enjoy the music with only minimal distortion.  And it sounds just as good at a low volume.  But the real kicker is the light display, something I wasn't sure I'd like but which won me over immediately.  You can even set the light show to match the tempo of the music.The BlackDiamond looks both futuristic and retro, a bizarre mix, I admit.  The light show is reminscent of disco, but the shape looks like some sort of crystal in a sci-fi movie.  The included remote control is a blast to use to control the light effects, but, of course, it also controls volume, skipping and returning to tracks, pause/play, mute, and power.The speaker comes with a storage pouch, a USB/wall charger, and an attached aux jack for wired connections.

The beauty of this iFlash international charger is that it comes with its adapters so that I can bypass one of the steps I often have to use.  The adapters (one for Europe and one for Asia -- it does not have the slanted prongs of the UK) slide directly into the US prongs when they are folded into the body.  And if I'm staying in the US?  I leave the US prongs folded into the body for easy travel and leave the adapters at home.The USB charger has two 1A ports and two 2.1A ports.  The blue light that shows that power is flowing through the device can be annoying in the middle of the night, but I also find that it is essential, especially since some hotel rooms have dead outlets.  The only thing this charger is missing is a carrying pouch since I really don't want to misplace the pieces.As long as international travelers need no more than the two rounded plugs (Asia) or the wide-spaced, rectangular ones for Europe, this charger will likely be a welcome addition to their baggage.

I have moved from the Otterbox commuter case to this case and I like this case much better. I like it better because it is slimmer and offers almost the same protection. The UAG case is also more slimmer/thinner and it is orange. The case has a little bit of a slippery feel to it but that does not affect me in my case. It has big cutouts from the lightning port and headphone jack too. Just be very careful not to crack the case if you take it off. I cracked the case once and I emailed UAG about it, they sent a promo code of the price of the case on their website so I can choose a different color if I wanted to as my replacement case. In all their emails they said they wanted all customers to have a flaw free case and to be happy with it. They sure made me happy. The support is fantastic but takes 2-4 days for a reply back. This case does not affect your screen protector. The case does not lose it color too and does not attraction fingerprints. One thing that you have to do is keep the Camera cut out free of dust. Dust gets piled up in it after a few weeks.Over all this case is a must have if you want to show off our good looking iPhone 5. this case has excellent support backed by it in case anything happens. I recommend this case to all iPhone 5 holders if they want a slim and great looking case that has great protection!","overall":5.0,"summary":"Awesome case for your iPhone 5 black!!","unixReviewTime":1371168000,"reviewTime":"2013-06-14T00:00:00"}

The other thing is that the case uses a lightning port to charge the case rather than the traditional micro USB port like used on all battery cases that I know of. The button to turn on and off the battery case is quite easy to press too. The headphone jack can only fit the Apple earphones kind of plug which makes you need to buy a mini extension. The volume and power button are exposed. A few things that stumped me was that the battery case only gave 0.5amps of power to charge the iPhone and has an input of 0.5amps to charge the battery case and ZuZo does not even advertise their own company name on it so it is a no name battery case. The camera opening is quite small and most likely not works with the iPhone 5s. The battery case has one feature that in actually do like and it is the built in stand. It is easy to access and use. I do feel like that it will break off in the future.Overall, I do not recommend getting this battery case.

The silent switch is very easy to access. The volume buttons are l covered and are easy to press l. The lock/ power button is also easy to press too. Like most other cases the lock and volume buttons are covered by a button on the case and the button is the shape of the physical button, but with the Tough Armor the buttons are not shown by its shape but is square and is size of the thickness of the iPhone (look at video). The volume buttons are engraved in a \"+\" and \"-\" to tell you which is volume up or down. The power button is labeled \"PWR\". The bottom right side of the case looking at the front where the lip is and engraving \"TOUGH ARMOR\". The case a 1.5mm lip so you can put the iPhone 5 screen down on a table and the screen will not touch the surface. The case is 2 pieces. One part is the tough flexible silicon piece and the other is the hard plastic piece that you choose the color of when buying. The Tough flexible silicon piece is matte black and the plastic piece is blacker in person than the pictures you see online. The case works with my Tech Armor screen protectors that I also recommend too. The case is easy to install and uninstall. My tip for installing; I put the side with the volume buttons in first then push the other side in. My tip for uninstalling; I push the top right corner(power button) and the bitter right corner and the bend the case little by little until the iPhone 5 loose enough to take out easily. There is no camera distortion when taking photos with flag because of the black ring around the camera cutout. On the button the lightning cutout is big enough to fit AmazonBasics lightning cable and that cable has a bigger end to it. He case can fit 99% of the lightning cables here on Amazon. When hold the iPhone 5 I the Tough Armor case I have god grip and I feel like if I drop it, my iPhone will still be in the condition it was in before dropping it. When the iPhone is not on the case and looking at the case, it looks cool because of the airflow technology. The pattern just looks cool (look at the video for pictures)!Overall, this is the best case I have. It look awesome, has tons of protection and I feel like my iPhone will never break. I am done using my Commuter case and I am going to use the Spigen Tough Armor for when I need a protected iPhone.This product 100% deserves a 5 star rating","overall":5.0,"summary":"My favorite ad my most protective iPhone 5 case","unixReviewTime":1380844800,"reviewTime":"2013-10-04T00:00:00"}

I've tried a few over the years, but always have found them to be a pain (literally!) if they are worn for more than 20 minutes or so. I'm very happy to report that the Moto is a dream when it comes to comfort - had it on for a three+ hour drive, and didn't even know it was there. Plus, it didn't cause a problem with my glasses, unlike other models I've tried.Set up was very straightforward - basically just follow the prompts and it works. I didn't try out the text-to-voice feature but it sounds interesting. Not really something I would use since I don't text much at all, but if you're text-heavy, that feature would certainly be of value.Audio quality was excellent. Had no problems hearing callers even with music playing in the car. Range was also very good.My complaints are two-fold. First a minor one - this comes packed in what I would consider to be wasteful packaging. Looks impressive in a clear, thick plastic box, but the amount of materials used for packing is unnecessary. I did not, however, deduct anything from its rating due to that.What did cause a loss of one star was the mic pickup. In a quiet environment it was fine. But, in a noisy environment (such as outside, in a crowded restaurant or with moderate-level music playing in the car), it picks up so much background noise that people had problems hearing me. To ensure this was actually the case, I loaned it to a friend and had him call me so I could hear for myself. It seems that the mic is either way too sensitive or not sufficiently directional - it truly is hard to hear the person's voice when they are using the headset should they be in anything other than a pretty quiet environment..But, that aside, this is the best headset I've used to date.

The controls are small and unobtrusive, which is nice from an aesthetic standpoint - the headset casing looks sleek. However, in actual usage, it can be hard to find the proper button by touch alone. Some type of tactile cue would have been nice to ensure you get to the right button each and every time.I also think the case could have been better. While it's stylish (sort of a triangular shape) with a crease in the cover that adds visual interest, there's no mesh or straps on the inside to hold the headphones and/or cables. The end result is that while the case looks nicer than others I've used, it's not as practical or functional. I find that to be a significant issue since I use these type of headphones away from home (e.g., at the gym, while exercising, etc.) and the carry case gets used a lot.Given that these are priced the same or a bit higher than other similar bluetooth headsets, these misses warrant dropping the rating by one star.

I can't tell you how many times I've hit an earbud cord while exercising and ripped the ear bud from my ear. A real pain in the neck (and ear!).>>>Pros:Comfort - These fit very well in my ear. There are different tip sizes to create a good fit and, after trying them all out, I went with the medium size. Very comfortable to wear even for long periods of time.Stay put - I've yet to have them fall out even when doing aerobic exercises or while on the treadmill.Sound - they sound pretty good. The sound is not as good as my favorite (and inexpensive) corded buds (RHA MA-350 Aluminium Noise Isolating In-Ear Earphones) but they are a solid B+ performer with regard to bass response and overall clarity. Keep in mind that good bass response is affected by how the buds fit in your ear, so it's important to try out different tip sizes to see how they affect sound quality. They do get harsh at loud volumes, but for normal listening they are more than fine for my non-audiophile ears. They do reasonably well at blocking out ambient noise.Setup - I found it straightforward even though I've never had any experience with setting up bluetooth earbuds.Size - nice and compact so you don't get the \"radar dish\" look that larger units can have.Durability - they have a \"sweat proof\" guarantee which is nice (although I imagine, like most guarantees, there are some loopholes). Overall build quality is good, with a very solid feel to all components.>>>Cons:Battery life - The manufacturer claims a battery life of 4.5 hours but I've yet to get more than 3 hours off a single charge. Plus there's no warning about battery life (until you're almost fully discharged) or a visual indicator of how much charge there is left.Usability - the buttons on the buds are too small, making it difficult for me to push the right one. A lot of fumbling and mis-presses, making it often easier to deal with volume changes on the device, which kills some of the value of having wireless buds.

But, while it had a number of great features, it didn't work well for me since the on/off button would not properly engage with the Kindle. So I was very interested to try out their new dock for the Samsung Galaxy/Note.Very pleased! Everything feels substantial, especially the phone cradles. It comes with a total of 5 cradles to fit the Galaxy S2, S3 and Note. I'm using the dock mainly with my S2, but also borrowed a Note to try that out (worked well). The cradles hold the phone securely, and rotate for either landscape or portrait viewing. I found it very easy to swap out cradles (no tools are needed).The dock itself can be flipped so it either rests on its side or on its back. It has non-slip pads on the both the base and the back of the dock to help keep it from sliding. I found you can also stand it on its end without any problems. It's not designed for this, so it's not the most stable position, but it's workable for me (I keep it on a small shelf above my desk, so space is at a premium).The power cord plugs into the back of the dock. I very much like that it does not have a wall wart at the end of the plug, but rather has an inline transformer. The cord that plugs into the dock is permanently attached to the transformer; the cord that plugs into the wall has a conventional 2-prong plug. You still have to deal with a transformer (it's a rectangular box about 2 inches by 4 inches, and about 1 inch thick) but it's not at the end of the plug where it would block other outlets.It comes with a slim remote that controls volume, power, bass and treble. You can also use it to switch to the aux input (more on that later). The remote does not control or interface with the phone - it only controls the features on the dock. It includes the flat battery (CR2025 size) which is a nice touch.The sound quality is quite good. Not audiophile good, but better than other docks I've tried in this price range. I very much like that the bass and treble are adjustable. In fact, be sure to play with them right when you first use the dock - the EQ settings on mine were really out of whack when I first set it up, with no bass output at all. Once adjusted, however, the bass output was much better.It has two 3 inch full-range speakers. Although the speakers are powered with an impressive 16 watts, a full-range speaker is just not going to provide room-filling thumping bass nor ultra-clear highs. If you want that you'll need to look elsewhere (and dig a lot deeper in your wallet to pay for it).  But given the g dock's price point I'm more than pleased with the sound quality.It has an aux input so you can plug in anything that has a standard 1/4 inch plug. I've tried it using a Sandisk MP3 player and a Kindle Fire. Works well and extends the usefulness of the dock beyond just a Samsung phone dock. It includes a male/male cord that is of pretty decent quality.It has the ability to run off of a battery pack that is sold separately. That was not included with my review unit so I can't provide any details about it. I see that Amazon has one for the Kindle Fire dock (Grace Digital Matchstick for Kindle Fire Rechargeable Battery Pack) but I don't know if that is the right one for this dock. I imagine it is, but will check with the manufacturer and report back. Having the battery pack is a great feature for portability. Note, however, that the battery pack only powers the dock and will not power or recharge the phone. The dock has to be plugged in for the latter.[UPDATE: The manufacturer got back to me very quickly, and confirmed that the Matchstick battery will work with the gdock]The main misses are with the controls. Or rather, the control indicator lights. The trend in many electronics these days is to have piercing indicator lights that appear much like miniature lighthouse beacons in a dark room. I really hate that! But, ironically, I'm not found of the g-dock's approach of having very muted indicator lights. They are covered by the speaker cloth which makes them even more difficult to see. This is not a major flaw since you can see them if you're close to the dock. Plus the remote covers all the bases if you're farther away from the dock. But I'd still like a more visible power indicator to remind me to turn it off. I also wish it had larger control buttons, and had better quality speaker cloth (or, better yet, metal mesh).But those minor issues aside, I think this is a great dock.

They all pretty much work the same (e.g., store up a charge and then allow you to use that to recharge a device) with the distinguishing features really coming down to aesthetics and, of course, capacity.This power bank does a good job on both fronts. It's rated at 10,400mAh. While I can't verify that quantitatively, it seems to be pretty accurate, as it was able to bring my Fire and phone to full charge without running out of juice.Design-wise this is one of the more attractive power banks I've used. The body is white plastic with black edging. It sort of looks like a large flip phone folded up. The plastic is high quality and feels substantial.It has a 4 light system to serve as a battery gas gauge. There are 2 5v USB output ports, each rated at 2A. I especially like that it has a built-in micro USB cable that stores neatly alongside the edge of the case. It is on the short side, however, measuring 4 inches from base to tip.The power bank itself is pretty compact, measuring about 3 inches by 4.25 inches and an inch thick. The edges are beveled to help make it seem smaller than it is. It weighs 8.5 ounces. Not lightweight, but quite good considering it's 10,000+ mAh capacity.It comes with an assortment of adapters as listed in the product specs. It does NOT include a wall charger adapter, nor does it include features such as a flashlight or a carry bag. But, it's also priced pretty well, so I'd rather have a lower price than features that don't directly impact usage as a power bank.There are only a couple of misses. I would have liked to see at least one of the output ports rated at 2.1A, and a longer built-in cable. But those aside, it's a nice power bank. Well worth a spot on your short list if you're shopping for one.[manufacturer provided sample for review]","overall":5.0,"summary":"Good performance and attractive design","unixReviewTime":1371081600,"reviewTime":"2013-06-13T00:00:00"}

It feels very solid, with a nicely molded case, rounded corners, and good quality input jacks. While build quality is not always an indicator of good engineering and performance, it's usually a good sign that care and thought went into the manufacturing process.The device is larger than I expected. It's about 2.5 by 3.75 inches, and weighs a hefty 7.4 ounces. Definitely something I'd carry in my briefcase rather than my pocket.(As an aside, I was also quite pleased with being able to unbox it without having to use any cutters. Two big thumbs up for not using that horrible clamshell packaging! It comes in a box with a plastic carrier that opens easily without any tools.)The overall concept of these devices is pretty straightforward. They contain one (or more) litium cells which take and store a charge. You can then use the stored charge to recharge a phone, tablet, etc. - pretty much anything that has modest power needs (e.g., you can't use it to recharge a full size laptop, for example).There's a series of indicator lights to let you know the charge level. Very useful not only to gague how much power you have left, but also to determine when it has been fully charged (via a wall outlet or USB port. Note that an AC adapter is not included).It has 2 USB outputs to allow it to charge 2 devices at the same time.Operation is very simple. Just plug and go (or rather, plug and wait for the device to receive a charge). I used it on a Kindle Fire to bring it from 10% to full charge, and had more than enough power left over in the Power Bank to recharge a Samsung phone. It took about 80 minutes to charge the Kindle; about 40 minutes for the phone. There was enough capacity left to top off the charge on a eGo 1100mAh mod (left it hooked up to the charger for 30 min, but unsure of the amount of charge that was put in since the eGo does not have a battery level indicator).It's a great device to carry along in the car or your briefcase for those times when your battery is running on empty and there's no easy way to plug into an outlet.

If offers 2 USB output ports (0.6A and 2.0A) an integrated LED flashlight and a charge level \"gas gauge.\" It offers a total of 8,400mAh capacity.What sets it apart from other power banks is its style - it is very nice looking! It's a high gloss black with a white accent strip on the side. The corners and sides are rounded, so it feel nice to carry and slips easily into a pocket. The charge level indicator consists of 4 blue circles on the front. It's probably the best-looking charge level indicator I've seen so far.The size is reasonable for its capacity - it weighs 6.5 ounces, and measures roughly 4 inches long by 2.5 inches wide. It's somewhat thick (3/4 inch).The build quality is good -- very solid feeling. The base is flat so it will stand up on edge securely. The two USB output ports are firmly attached with no wiggling even when I stressed the attached cables. The micro USB input for charging is also securely fastened.It comes with the usual variety of adapters and connectors so it can be used with pretty much everything. It also includes a wall adapter plug and a decent carry pouch.It does not have an auto-on feature. You have to push the power on button when you want the attached device to start charging.Given that the output is limited to 2A, this is not a good choice for tablet charging. But, given the 8,400mAh capacity, it really is more geared to phone and small device use rather than tablet charging. So, I won't hold that against it. Note that while the product listing states \"2.6A output\" that referrs to the combined total output -- one 2A outlet and 1 0.6A outlet. The max it can put out to a connected device is 2A.What I will hold against it is, ironically, related to one of it's major pluses - appearance. While the glossy black looks great, it's also a major fingerprint magnet. And I mean major! While the gloss looks great when it's clean, it's not nearly as good looking when it's all smudged up (which happens quickly). A matte finish would have been a better option.I'll nick this a half-star for the fingerprint attraction feature, but will round the overall rating up to 5 stars since it does everything else very well. Well worth considering if you're looking for a decent capacity power bank for phone use that is well-built and looks nice.

In these regards, the Intocircuit does a very nice job.The power bank offers 11,200mAh of power which gives it enough capacity to cover a few charges of a small device (such as a phone) or one charge of a larger device (such as a tablet). In my case, I use it mainly to keep my Kindle Fire 8.9 charged, and it does a capable job - for example, it brought it from 30% to 80% charge while still retaining enough capacity to recharge my Samsung phone from nearly empty to full.But, pretty much any power bank of a similar mAh rating could do the above tasks. What I like about this one is the overall design - it looks nice! The case (I have the gray one) is metal with a brushed finish. The end-caps are plastic, but have a softness to them. The overall affect is that it feels and looks nice, rather than cheap and \"plasticy.\"It's more compact than other power banks I've used in this power range. It measures about 4.5 inches tall and 2.75 inches wide. It's pretty thick - just shy of 1 inch thick. It also has some heft, weighing in a 9.9 ounces. Unfortunately, size and weight are the prices paid for more capacity, but this power bank does a good job of keeping things manageable.All the ports are at one end. It offers two outputs (1 is 2.1A; the other is 1.0A rated), an 5v in connection and a LED flashlight. The ports are well-attached with no wiggling or give even when I put a lot of stress on the cables. On the front is a decent-size, clear screen that shows a battery icon with the charge level. It also indicates which ports are in use. There's an on/off button, but it's not necessary to turn it on to use - it has an auto-on feature that engages the charging as soon as the cables are attached.You can use the on button for the flashlight (press it twice rapidly to turn on the flashlight). It's a nice touch since I'm often using this in a car and an extra light to see the ports is helpful. It puts out a decent amount of light - more than enough to see where what goes where when inserting cables.The power bank comes with an assortment of the usual attachments to cover a range of devices. I won't list them here since they are in the product listing. I only used the micro USB cable (which worked just fine and felt decently made), so I can't speak to how well the other attachments work.It also comes with a soft pouch that is large enough to hold the power bank plus a few attachments. I was especially pleased to see that it comes with an AC adaptor - other power banks I've used skip that. The adapter is compact and fits easily in the pouch. The amp rating for the adapter is not listed on the adapter nor in the specs.There are some misses:1. The lettering for the port power output (1.0 or 2.1 amp) is black on black and VERY hard to see unless there's bright light. I stuck an adhesive dot next to the 2.1 port so I could easily spot it.2. The on/off button is very small and feels cheap, unlike the rest of the power bank. While it is not needed much since this is an auto-on devoice, a larger button with a better \"click\" feel would have been nice.3. The screen is clear but the screen cover is thin and flexes. Again, it introduces a somewhat cheap feel to an otherwise solid device. The screen is also a fingerprint magnet (unlike the case, which is fingerprint-proof due to the brushed finish).4. No power rating for the AC adapter.I'll keep the rating at 5 stars since these misses 1-3 are mostly cosmetic; miss #4 is more of my curiosity than an essential issue.

It has an impressive 12,000mAh capacity which is great when it comes to utility, but it comes at a cost: size and weight. It clocks in at a hefty 11.5 ounces, and measures about 3 inches wide and 5.75 inches tall.To help keep the size manageable, the edges are rounded so it feels very comfortable in hand. I also appreciate the ergonomics of the device - it has 4 USB ports at the top so you can keep the power bank upright, on its side, or on its edge when in use. All edges are flat so it usually stays put however it's positioned. I say \"usually\" since it did topple over on me when I bumped it while it was positioned upright. A broader base on the bottom edge would have been more functional, rather than the rounded off (but admittedly more attractive) styling.The overall build quality seems good. The case is plastic (white on both sides and silver on the edge). All the ports seems well-fastened, and didn't budge at all when I stressed the cords.It has four charging ports. All are 5V, with one each for 0.5A, 1.0A, 1.3A and 2.1A. The rating for each port is printed clearly on the case, which is a welcome addition. It has a 4 LED \"gas gauge\" to show the power level remaining, and a micro USB port for input charging. There's an on/off button that also serves to illuminate the charge remaining indicator.It comes with a wide range of connectors (I won't list them here since they are in the product description) to cover pretty much any charging situation. It also comes with a nice drawstring pouch (about 3.75 wide and 5.75 tall and made of good quality nylon) to hold all the attachments. You can also use the pouch to hold the power bank itself, but it's about an inch too short to completely encase the device.The one thing it lacks, however, is a charger (e.g., a USB AC adapter). One is sold separately. The manual states that a 500mA charger should not be used. Unfortunately, all I had was a 500mA charger. I emailed the company, and was told that a 500mA charger is fine in that it won't damage the charge bank, but it will take much longer to charge. That was certainly the case - it took overnight and then some (about 15 hours) to bring the charge bank from 1 LED (low charge) to 4 LEDs (full charge) using the 500mA charger I had. According to the email I received, the power bank can work with a charger up to 2000mA. (Note, however, that on the back of the device it states a max input of 1500mA). A higher powered charger would certainly bring the charge time down to a more reasonable length of time.Nothing much to say about usage other than it works! It is functionally identical to pretty much every other power bank I've used other than the fact that the 12,000 mAh capacity allowed me to bring my Kindle Fire 8.9 from 10% to 90% charge, and still had enough juice to bring my Samsung phone from nearly empty to full charge. Smaller power banks I've used (such as 6,000 or 7,500 mAh) would be empty before even reaching the 60% mark on just the Fire.This is well worth considering if you want a lot of spare \"juice\" at the ready, and are willing to deal with the larger size and weight of a higher mAh device. It's well-made, and at the current price, a very good value when you figure the cost per mAh.

It easily took my Kindle Fire 8.9 from nearly empty to nearly full, and still had some reserve left to handle a full recharge of a small mp3 player. Impressive!The down side to this capacity is the size of the unit. It is about 2.75 inches wide, 4.75 inches tall and nearly an inch thick. It weighs 11 ounces, so it's not exactly pocket friendly.The case is white and made of good quality plastic. The edges on the sides are rounded to make it easier to hold. I like that both ends are squared off - it stands up very securely on end even with cables plugged into the ports (the weight does come in handy to keep it stable). The ports are well anchored into the device with no wiggling even when the cables were stressed.All ports are on the top edge. There are two USB output ports (rated at 2.1A), a micro USB input port to recharge the powerbank, the on/off switch and a 4-position LED \"gas gauge\" to show you the power level remaining (it uses 4 very small blue LEDs as indicators). There is also a LED flashlight that comes on if you press and hold the on button for a few seconds. While a flashlight feature is a nice touch for small powerbanks that you can carry in your pocket, I don't see much value in having it on such a large device. I would have rather seen an additional power outlet or two rather than the flashlight.It comes with a USB charging cable and a wall outlet adapter. Both appear to be of decent quality. It does not include a carry case or adapters for various devices.I'll give this 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5) since if offers a huge amount of reserve power, has more than decent build quality given the price, and stands up on edge without a hint of a wobble. However, it would definitely benefit from an additional USB outlet, ideally on the side of the device. That would allow me to plug in a cable straight on rather than have to plug it in on top. I'd also would like it to lose the LED flashlight in favor of more inputs and/or a larger size power indicator LEDs.This is well worth considering if you're interested in carrying along a surplus of reserve power and are willing to deal with the larger size and weight of the powerbank.[Sample provided for review]","overall":5.0,"summary":"Not lightweight, but lots of power on tap","unixReviewTime":1376265600,"reviewTime":"2013-08-12T00:00:00"}

The on/off button is also blue, as is the charge level \"gas gauge.\" Nice color coordination. The build quality is solid - no rattles, well-anchored ports, and nice smooth seams on the case. The corners are all rounded to make it more comfortable to slip into a pocket. Although it comes with a carry pouch, it's really not needed since the powerbank is so compact (roughly 3.75 inches long and 1.75 inches wide).In addition to serving as a powerbank, there's an LED flashlight that is controlled with the on/off switch (double press to turn the flashlight on). It's a single LED, but puts out a decent amount of light.The capacity limits the practical use of this for phone or small device (e.g., ipod, mp3 player, etc.) charging. There's not enough reserve to make a meaningful recharge of a fully-depleted tablet.

It is housed in a matte finish white plastic case with gray accents on the edges.

The Gorilla goes a step further with the flashlight by having 2 LEDs.

The on/off switch is small, flush mounted, and the same color as the case. That makes it hard to find, especially in dim light. Lastly, the power ratings for the output ports are gray on gray inscribed lettering, which makes them nearly impossible to see unless you look closely under a good light.While these issues collectively drop my rating to 4 stars, it remains a good device that is well worth considering if you want something that packs a lot of reserve power into a small footprint.[Sample provided for review]","overall":4.0,"summary":"Very compact dimensions for the capacity","unixReviewTime":1380153600,"reviewTime":"2013-09-26T00:00:00"}

They won't dazzle you with superlative sound, but I was not at all disappointed with the sound quality.There's not a lot of sound isolation from ambient noise, and there is also a fair amount of sound leakage when using the earphones at a moderate to loud volume. That's not a negative since those features are inherent given the over the ear design. At this price point, or even above, earbuds are far better at keeping outside sounds out and keeping others from hearing your musicWhat I like the best about these is the overall design. The control buttons on the right earpiece are shaped so you can find them easily with your finger without fumbling.

I've seen that feature on a couple of other powerbanks, but PBS does it very well - the wrap-around design for the cable keeps in handy and also adds some visual interest to the powerbank.The wrap-around cable has a rubbery covering that appears very sturdy and able to withstand quite a bit of use. It snaps securely into a groove in the powerbank so it does not unfold when you don't want it to unfold. It can also be removed should you want to use your own cable.Additionally, the powerbank has an Apple-to-USB adapter that fits into a slot in the device and is held in place by the wrap-around cable. A great feature if you want to charge an Apple device - the adapter is there when you need it, and stows neatly when it's not being used.On the downside, it only has one USB output, and the size is a bit larger than other 5000mAh powerbanks. It measures about 2.25 side and 5 inches tall, which is notably larger than other powerbanks in it's power range.

It's not the best choice for tablet recharging - you'd want to step up to at least a powerbank with an 8000+mAh rating for that.Well worth considering if you value convenience in a powerbank, and are willing to deal with a somewhat larger device to get that.[Sample provided for review]","overall":5.0,"summary":"Convenient design for a powerbank","unixReviewTime":1380585600,"reviewTime":"2013-10-01T00:00:00"}

It also looks quite nice - matte black finish that has more styling and visual interest than the typical power adapter. There's an indicator ring at the end that lights up (blue) to confirm it is working. The blue light is soft and is not horribly distracting at night. However, I would have preferred a single pinpoint indicator light rather than a ring.It fits securely into the power outlet without having to force it in or struggle to take it out. It did not jar loose when going over rough spots in the road.The attached cable is coiled and can stretch quite a distance. In its coiled state it extends about 20 inches; fully stretched out is about double that distance. I had no problems having the cord reach a tablet in the back seat from the center console power plug.The coiled cable cannot be detached from the power adapter, but since it is coiled, it does not get in the way if I leave the adapter plugged into the power outlet. There's also a conventional USB outlet at the end of the power adapter so you can use your own cable, or connect 2 devices at the same time.Zero problems with this, and I absolutely love the design.

Really impressive!The overall build quality is quite good, and the angular shape gives this a lot more visual interest than the usual square or rectangular box.

But, it does everything pretty well, and, more importantly, does it all at a very impressive price point. Well worth a look.Full review:The first thing I thought when I opened the package was &#34;blah.&#34; These are not very exciting looking earbuds. They are not ugly, just rather plain looking plastic rectangles. Since there is no product photo at the time I'm posting this review, I uploaded a photo to give an idea of how they look.The second though I had was &#34;uncomfortable.&#34; That proved to be my fault - I put them on as I do my other bluetooth buds, with the cord at my neck. After struggling to get them to have some measure of comfort, I looked at the user guide and followed the instructions for wearing them (cord in the back; loop the cord over your ear; position the buds with the cord entry up). Smooth sailing after that, and they turned out to be one of the more comfortable and lightweight buds I've used.The build quality is not sterling, but more than adequate given the price. The on/off switch (called the multi-controller) has a positive click, which is good, but is positioned in such a way that you have to hit it with a fingernail to depress it. The cord is of decent quality, but could benefit from a couple extra inches of length for greater flexibility in use. The volume control &#34;bumps&#34; are a bit hard to find with your finger when wearing the buds.No problems pairing it with a Kindle Fire. The bluetooth range is quite good - about 20 feet with zero dropouts; about 25 feet with only a minor drop out or two.The sound quality is impressive with regard to bass - it puts out far more bass than I expected. A bit muddy, but still more than ample. It does fall a bit short on the mid and upper ranges. The muddiness continues and becomes more apparent. The result is adequate, but not impressive sound quality. It's better suited to bass-heavy music or movie dialog than light instrumentals or vocals. It does excel with regard to volume - you can crank these guys way up!Another area of excellence is sound isolation. The buds fit snugly (it comes with three sizes of tips for adjustment) and do a great job of cutting out external noise. That's important for me, since my primary use will be while exercising, and external noise is always irritating.It recharges using a supplied USB cable. The charge port seems well-anchored and has a rubber flap to keep out dirt and moisture. It also comes with a really nice carry pouch. Sort of a velvet-like material with a drawstring top closure.At the present price point (roughly $30) these are very impressive performers. No, they don't excel in every area, but they hit a performance level that makes them a great choice for &#34;rough&#34; use (e.g., workouts, kids, etc.). A good match for when you want enough performance to enjoy using them, but still keep the cost low so you won't cry if they get crushed underfoot while on the treadmill, or the kids lose them.4.5 stars rounded to 5 since I am quite impressed with the comfort and sound isolation.[Sample provided for review]","overall":5.0,"summary":"Some faults, but very impressive for the price","unixReviewTime":1379462400,"reviewTime":"2013-09-18T00:00:00"}

That's a very handy feature for people such as myself who like to quantify things - I feel better knowing that I have 43% power left rather than just seeing 2 light out of 4.  The display also counts up when the powerbank is being recharged, so you have a far more accurate determination of how much time it will take to charge up. Very nice feature.There are also some other pluses to this powerbank. It has a significant capacity (10000mAh) but packs it into a pretty compact size, with the powerbank measuring just short of 3 inches wide and about 4.25 inches tall. The weight is a bit hefty at 8.5 ounces.The on/off switch can easily be found, unlike other powerbanks that seem to try their best to hide the switch. It's large, round, located on the top side, and is well-marked with a silver ring around it. It also has a nice click to it. Very well done.It has an LED bulb to serve as a flashlight, and the bulb is located on the side rather than the top. The positioning makes it much easier to use as a flashlight.The overall build quality seems solid, with well-anchored ports and a nicely seamed plastic case. It also comes with a cloth carry pouch, a USB cable and an assortment of the usual adapters.Unfortunately, there are some clear misses as well. On the minor miss side, the case is a huge fingerprint magnet. One of the worst I've seen in it's ability to get smudged and display those smudges. Also, the port labels are embossed into the plastic and are pretty much impossible to read even under good light.The worst issue relates to the best feature - the LCD screen. It's positioned very oddly. To read the digits properly, you have to look at it with the USB ports facing down. The screen is thus at the bottom of the case, making it hard to see. That's a really silly design flub, in my opinion.The case bottom (the end opposite that of the USB ports) is rounded, so the powerbank can't stand up unless you position it on its edges. While a rounded end looks nice, it's just not practical.The size is also a bit of a problem in that it's squat and wide, making it difficult to fit into laptop bag pouches, and making it feel uncomfortable in-hand. Skinnier and taller would have been a better direction to go in when it was designed.Given the price point, these design flubs are a let-down, and drop my rating to 3.5 stars. Hopefully, the next version of this will address these design issues since the digital power level indicator is such a helpful feature.[Sample provide for review]","overall":3.0,"summary":"Love the digital power level display, but some clear design misses on this powerbank","unixReviewTime":1380931200,"reviewTime":"2013-10-05T00:00:00"}

It's about the same size as a handset - roughly 5 inches long and just under 3 inches wide. In fact, it could easily be confused with a phone at first glance.The back is white; the charging surface is black and there's a silver accent strip around the edge. It looks quite nice and feels solid. Granted, a solid feeling is not always an accurate indication of good internal build quality, but this clearly does not feel \"cheap\" in hand. The charge surface has a non-slip soft texture to it so items placed on it for charging will not be scratched regardless if they are bumped around a bit.Usage is about as simple as can be. Plug it in; put the device that needs to be charged on top, and you're done. There's a LED indicator on the charger that shows charge in progress (blinking) and completed (solid). The light, according to the manual, will turn red should there be a short. I never experienced that, so I can't verify that particular feature.It worked perfectly with my Nexus. Just place it on top and leave it be. Wished more things worked that well.My only quibble is with the power cord. It has the inevitable wall wart, which is unavoidable, but the build quality of the AC adapter seems less solid than the charger itself. It works just fine, but I couldn't avoid getting a \"cheap\" impression when I handled it. I won't detract from the rating since it functions just fine, but it seems at odds with the sleek, solid feeling of the charger itself. I also would have liked to have a longer power cord. It's more than ample for counter-top use in the kitchen (where it probably will be most of the time), but the cord was too short to put the charger on my desk and plug the cord into a power strip on the floor.Looks nice, works well, and simple to use.

They excel with regard to comfort - the ear padding is plush and they have a nice balance between grip (e.g., staying put when you move) and comfort. The headband consists of 2 plastic rods without any padding, but doesn't cause a significant comfort issue.I had zero problems pairing these with a couple of different tablets (Android operating system and the Fire version of Android). Simple, quick and painless. The operating range is also excellent, with zero dropouts at about 20 feet and only minor dropouts at 25+ feet.The sound quality is quite good. While these open-ear designs don't have the booming bass quality of closed designs, I found the sound quality to be very good, especially in the midrange. They are an excellent choice for movie watching since the dialogue comes through so clearly.I like the operating controls, especially the volume switch. It's a rocker-type design, so it's very easy to use without having to look at the button - just find it by feel, and press up to increase volume and down to decrease. The multifunction button is in the middle of the rocker switch and is very easy to find by touch as well.The overall look is very snazzy, and the build quality appears solid.There is only a modest amount of sound isolation, but that again is an issue inherent with open-ear headphones. It does cut ambient sound reasonably well - I had no problems listening to music while on a noisy treadmill without the ambient sound interfering to any significant degree.Misses are the volume level. These have a rather limited upper volume range. Normally I set my tablet to about the 75% level and the headphone level to close to the upper point to get a good volume that blocks out ambient noise. With these, however, I had to set the tablet sound level to 100% and the earphone level also at 100%, and I still found them a bit lacking in volume. Given the price point, the range should be better.But other than the volume issue, no complaints. Good sound, good comfort, great range and easy-to-use controls.

It&#8217;s also non-slip, which is an added bonus for me since I tend to drop things a lot.Putting the case on is simple &#8211; just pop off the top portion, slide in the phone, and replace the top.

The packaging doesn't impact product performance, but it is so nicely done that it&#8217;s worth mentioning.The only issue that could be a negative is that it gets hot when charging. Not burn your fingers hot, but definitely more than just warm.This is a lot more expensive than a similarly-sized standalone powerbank, and even more expensive than a powerbank with far more capacity.

The benefit of a small bluetooth speaker is the ability to carry it with you and, while some do come with a case, they are usually a thin nylon sack that offers zero protection. This case, however, is really well made. It has padding on the sides that provides protection in transit, a well-made zipper that you don't have to struggle with, and has two mesh pockets on the inside to keep cables stowed.I know it may sound a bit silly to go on about the case to that degree, but often it's the little things like that often make a product so much nicer to use.The speaker case is another strong plus for me. It is a soft, rubbery material that is highly slip resistant. Plus, it looks great, totally hides fingerprints, and feels nice as well. The attractive design extends to the grills, which are metal and look and feel nice as well.The control buttons on the front face for volume are small, but clearly marked. They have a solid click when depressed. The power and connection ports are on the edge and are recessed into the soft cover so that they don't interfere with positioning the speaker on-end should you want to.The sound quality is pretty good. The speaker has the same limitations of any other small speaker in that the bass is, at best, somewhat adequate, and the midrange is on the muddy side. But sound quality is always relative. This sounds 1,000 times better than the internal speaker of any tablet I've ever used, but it won't compare with the sound quality of a high end powered speaker. Given the price point, I consider the sound quality to be more than acceptable.Zero problems with operation - paired easily with a variety of bluetooth devices. It also can be used as a direct-connect speaker using a 3.5mm cable (included). This is where there's a quirk in the design. For some reason the volume controls are reversed when using it in direct connect mode - the minus button makes it louder and the middle button makes it softer. I didn't realize that was the way it was supposed to work until I read it in the instruction pamphlet (which is another high point - the manual is actually well written and helpful!). Strange quirk, but not something that detracts from usage.This is one of the better small speakers I've used, and while it is a bit more expensive than others, the better build quality, nicer design, and extras such as an excellent case make it a better value than most.

The bass is light; the mid-range is muddy, and it clips off the high-end sound. But, considering the price and the fact that it's a bluetooth speaker, it's certainly acceptable. Just don't expect Jawbone-level sound quality, despite the name being referenced in the product listing.I do like the overall design. The case is made of a soft, rubbery material that feels nice and, more importantly, is 100% non-slip. You can put this on a steep incline (such as the control panel for a treadmill) and it will not budge whatsoever. The color is a vibrant blue, which looks nice, and the grill is metal (or at least it feels like metal) with an embossed diamond pattern. It's also compact, measuring only about 6 inches long, 1.75 wide, and about 2.25 tall. That makes it easy to take along, but no doubt contributes to the average sound quality and light bass.Unlike other low-end speakers it includes a slot to take a TF card (a microSD card) to play music directly from it. I don't have such a card handy, so I was not able to test that feature.But all those good points are marred by one really annoying one: it speaks (or rather shouts) its bluetooth status. So, when you first turn it on, a man's voice states \"Bluetooth model has been opened.\" At least, that's what I think he's saying - it's heavily accented English.I can't find a way to turn that off, or even make it softer. It's funny the first couple of times, but quickly becomes a real annoyance.While the features make this a decent performer for the price, and I love the casing material, the loud, annoying voice drops this to 3 stars.*** UPDATE: The manufacturer contacted me and provided me with a way to cut the volume of the announcement. Basically you need to update the unit's firmware using an SD card (download the code onto the card, insert the card, turn on the speaker, and let it be until it has updated).  I have to give the manufacturer credit for following up and addressing the issue.  Based on the update, I changed my rating for the product to 4 stars since the update addresses what was for me a major annoyance.

The latter feature is usually not very well done with small powerbanks, but this has a 4 LED indicator just like many larger powerbanks that keeps you abreast of the power level remaining.The case is metal (appears to be aluminum) and is very well machined. It has a very slight texture to it for a secure grip plus zero fingerprints. The build quality overall feels solid, including the power button and the USB port. The base is flat so it will stand up without any wobble. I like that it's square rather than round since that prevents it from rolling around when I have it in the car. The color is nice as well - I have the gold one, and it's very attractive.The power button has a soft click feel to it, and is large enough so it's easy to find. It is not an auto on device - you have to press the button to start it charging an attached device.All the ports (a USB output and a micro USB input) are on the top. The output is 1A which is fine for most phones, but not suitable for larger devices, such as tablets. But, given the capacity of 2600mAh, this is a powerbank that is geared towards phones and other small devices, so the 1A output works well.The only thing lacking is a LED bulb so this could be used as a flashlight.

Excellent clarity for both reception and transmission. I was not expecting that given the price. Impressive!Usage is straightforward, and on a par with other headsets I've used. The control buttons are small, so there is some fumbling when first getting used to it. They are raised to make them easier to find by touch, but they are both the same size and shape, so I did find myself hitting the vol down when I wanted to hit the vol up. Different sized or shaped buttons would have been nicer. Still, after a bit of practice it becomes pretty straightforward to use.  I had zero problems pairing this with a Samsung.Comfort was less than ideal. I wouldn't go as far to call it uncomfortable, but other headsets I&#8217;ve used, especially those from Motorola, seem to fit my ear better. This is certainly workable, but it would not be my first choice in terms of comfort for a several hour long car trip. I definitely got some ear fatigue using it. More padding, or more plush padding would be nice. A softer or more pliable ear band would also be welcomed.However, the sound quality more than makes up for some small comfort misses. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.

It's a \"lipstick case\" format, which makes it very easy to take along in a pocket or bag. The downside is, as expected, capacity - it is rated at 2600mAh, which won't go far if you have a tablet or other similar power-heavy device. It's far more suited to recharging phones or other low-mAh capacity batteries.It comes with a variety of adapters to cover pretty much all the bases, and a nice velvet-type cloth carry bag.It also fits inside the leather carry case/pouch (using the inner loop) of the Innokin MVP or VTR, should you have one of those.The outer case appears to be metal (I'll guess aluminum). Looks nice, and offers a lot more protection from dings and scuffs than the typical plastic case.Where is misses is with regard to status lights. It has a red light for when the powerbank is being charged, and a blue light to indicate when it is in use (e.g., charging another device). There are no lights to indicate the charge left.It also is pretty sparse with regard to specifications. Nowhere in the product literature or on the case does it indicate the rating of the output port. I'm going to guess it's 1A since that's the customary output for a powerbank of this size, but the omission of basic info such as port power rating (or, for that matter, mAh rating) is not appropriate for this type of product.[UPDATE:  I emailed the manufacturer and was told that the output is 0.9A. I was impressed with how quickly they responded (less than 1 day).

However, the large capacity ones are basically like carrying around a brick. This powerbank, while only offering 3000mAh, comes packaged as a very easy to take along format.It's weighs only 2.5 ounces and is about 4.25 inches long and less than an inch thick. The case is plastic, but the quality is quite good, with nicely matched seams. All the edges are rounded so it feels comfortable to hold. The bottom edge is flat, and allows it to stand upright without toppling over.Although it's small, it still has all the main features of a powerbank. It has one USB output (2.1A), a micro USB input for charging (with each port next to each other), and a 4 LED \"gas gauge\" that shows the charge level. On the end opposite the port it has an LED flashlight. Normally the flashlight feature is of minor use on a conventionally-shaped powerbank, but in this case it actually works very well as a flashlight. In fact, I could see people buying it mainly to use just for that. The flashlight lens is recessed and has a nicely designed surround.It comes with two USB cables, both of which are stout and durable. It also comes with two lanyards: one that is long enough for neck use; another shorter one for (I imagine) wrist use. Since the powerbank is so small and light, wearing it on a lanyard is very feasible. The lanyard construction is just so-so, but decent enough for general use.  It also comes with a user guide that is actually helpful and well-written. Don't see that much anymore!Operation is fine - works just like any other powerbank. But, to be useful, a powerbank has to be carried along with you. The size makes that very easy to do, and the flashlight performance and design makes this even more useful to carry with you.

Just press the case near the top to engage the button. It has a soft positive click to it. The volume up and down buttons are on the sides and are pretty thin. But, they are elongated rocker style buttons which helps to find them by touch.It charges via a USB cable (included). The manufacturer claims a 4 hour talk time, which is pretty accurate based on my use. There's no flap covering the micro USB input port. Not an issue for me (since I always loose those flaps anyway), but I wanted to note it in case it's important for others.Where it falls short a bit is comfort. The earpiece has a rubber cover, but essentially no padding. It's good at staying put in my ear, but not so good when it comes to long-term comfort. Definitely get some ear fatigue with this. The ear loop is flexible and pretty soft, but again, no padding.

It's not as sleek looking, but it allows me to use the mount for either a phone or a GPS. The max width that the clip will hold is roughly 4 inches. While the clip is plastic, the spring is very strong, and the clip jaws have padding to avoid scratching whatever it is holding. It pivots so you can switch between portrait and landscape mode.The magnet option works well too. The magnet held my phone firmly over bumps. It comes with a small piece of metal (roughly 2 by 2 inches) with an adhesive backing if your phone case does not have a magnetic attachment capability.The suction cup has a good amount of grip provided it's placed on a clean, smooth surface.

It&#8217;s not huge (measures about 3.5 inches ling and 2.25 inches wide) but it&#8217;s much more bulky than the typical one or two port car charger.The thickness also contributes to its bulk &#8211; it&#8217;s about 1.25 inches thick since it includes 2 power ports (e.g., cigarette lighter ports) on the side. I can&#8217;t see a real reason for that unless you want to use this to power something else that needs a power port, such as an old-style GPS. Since most devices these days get powered with a USB cable, having two power ports on the side just seems to add bulk rather than value.But you do get an advantage for the large size &#8211; capacity. This has four USB output ports on the top. Two are rated for 3A output; the other 2 are not rated but I would imagine they are 2.1A or so since they are labeled for use with an iPhone/iPad.The power cord is stout and well-attached.

Great feature for ease of carrying this around.The sound quality is pretty good. It&#8217;s a bit muted sounding, but the bass response is excellent &#8211; better than expected given the small size.The controls are all on the same end, and consist of an on/off button, a micro USB input for charging, and a 3.5mm input jack for direct connects.

The bluetooth range is very good, with zero dropouts at about 25 feet. As expected, the direct connect option worked perfectly.The only negative is that it lacks volume control.

The back of the cradle has an insert that, while not soft, helps provide a good grip.The ball and socket joint works well and has a pretty fluid motion. I especially like how the suction cup was done, with a lever that flexes the cup to provide solid attachment (provided that the surface to which it is being attached is smooth and clean).The only downside is that everything is made of plastic.

However, it&#8217;s a powerbank rated at 6000mAh. Given that most powerbanks are so utilitarian looking, I&#8217;m impressed with the thought that went into this design.The powerbank has a single USB output port rated at 1A (located at the top) and a micro USB input port for recharging the powerbank (located on the side). It also has a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; indicator to show the power level left in the powerbank, and a pretty bright single LED flashlight (turns on with 2 quick pushes of the power button). The power button is small, but is raised enough so it&#8217;s easy to find by touch. It has a nice positive click when pressed.The overall build quality is excellent. It is all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality, and the seams are even and tight. All the edges are rounded, as is the overall shape from front to back, making it comfortable to hold and easy to fit into a pocket. It&#8217;s mostly a high gloss black with a smoky gray accent strip around the front. All in all, it looks quite nice.Operation is easy and straightforward &#8211; just connect the device you want to charge to the USB port and let it charge. The 6000mAh capacity and 1A output rating makes it more suitable for phones and small devices rather than tablets.It comes with a decent mesh pouch that is padded, and a micro USB cable. The instruction guide is brief but mostly well-written (which is a refreshing change from the usual situation).My only quibble is that the gloss finish is a fingerprint magnet.

It&#8217;s a small-capacity powerbank (3000mAh) with a single 1A output port, so it&#8217;s best for small devices (such as phones, mp3 players, etc.) rather than larger devices (such as tablets).It includes a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the power level of the powerbank. Those are a little too bright for my taste, but I like the color (green). It also includes a flashlight which puts out a considerable amount of light. The flashlight can also be set to flash on and off, which (to me) is a rather silly feature, but it can easily be avoided when using the flashlight.The case is metal and feels very substantial. It&#8217;s light (weighs only 2.8 ounces) but has a good, solid feel to it. The on/off button is easy to find and has a good click to it so you know it has been depressed.My complaints are that it does not stand up without a wobble. If you stand it up so the output ports are at the top, the flashlight lens protrudes enough that the powerbank does not sit flat. If you lay it flat on the flattened side, the power button protrudes and again, gives it a wobble. It&#8217;s not a big deal and not something that would lower my rating, but it&#8217;s a bit irritating.My other complaint is with the packaging.

I have bluetooth buds that are less than a quarter of the price of these that put out pretty much the same sound quality. These sound a bit tinny with little depth, and the bass is muddy. Nothing special or even a little outstanding about the sound quality. The volume range is limited compared with other earbuds &#8211; even at the max volume it did not put out the volume I was looking for.While they paired up with my tablets easily, they disconnected several times each time I used them. This may be due to the fact that I was using them at the gym, which has a lot of other people using bluetooth systems plus a lot of machinery. However, I nearly always use bluetooth headphones (or bluetooth-connected speakers of some sort) there, and this is the first time that has happened, so I am attributing the problem to the Jabra equipment.Given the problems with connection, the only average sound quality and limited volume, the best I can offer these is a below average rating.

The buttons have a slight click to them so you get tactile feedback that it has been pressed. The ports (a 3.5mm input port for a direct connect and a micro USB port for recharging) are also on the front for easy access.  It measures 3 inches wide at the base, and is 2.75 inches high (at the highest point).The base has a non-slip pad. I initially thought the pad was just so-so, but then I realized it comes packed with a plastic sheet over the pad which you need to peel off. With the plastic off, it provides excellent non-slip performance even when jarred.Pairing was quick and easy, as was using the direct connect method. Bluetooth range was great, with a solid connection at 20 or so feet. The internal battery is rated at 500mAh which is pretty decent for a speaker this size.The sound quality is excellent in terms of clarity. The mid and upper ranges come through very nicely, making this great for dialog or podcasts. The bass is there, but it&#8217;s not all that pronounced. If you like a strong, booming bass in your sound, this is probably not a good choice. However, if you prize clarity with enough bass to round things out well, this probably won&#8217;t disappoint.The only notable negative is the user guide. Although this comes very nicely packaged to make it look upscale, the user guide is very brief, not that helpful, and poorly translated. It&#8217;s not an issue that warrants a down rating overall (since many of the features are self-explanatory if you've used this type of speaker before) but it sticks out as being at odds with the attention paid to product styling and packaging.It&#8217;s a little more expensive than typical portable bluetooth speakers, but the build quality, looks, and features (large battery plus mic for phone use) make it a decent value.

While the idea is interesting, the actual execution needs to go back to the drawing board.On the plus side, the powerbank itself is quite nice. It has a sturdy metal case, a large on/off button, and a compact shape that&#8217;s easy to carry (about 3.5 inches long, 1.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick). The rounded edges make it easy to hold. There&#8217;s a single USB output port on the top next to a large, and very bright LED flashlight.

It has the customary LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the power level left.The voice recording is a mess, however. The instructions on how to use it are almost indecipherable. I finally got it working through trial and error. The audio is stored on a micro SD card (which is included) that you insert in the base of the powerbank. There&#8217;s a cover you&#8217;re supposed to then stick over it, but there&#8217;s no cutout for the SD card &#8211; the only cutout is for the adjacent micro USB port that is used to recharge the powerbank. So, once you stick on the adhesive cover, you&#8217;re prevented from removing (at least easily removing) the SD card.There is no clear indication as to when the recorder is recording and when it is not. The overall recording user interface is very poor.While the powerbank can record, it cannot play back. You need to hook the powerbank to a PC and download the file to play it. Getting it connected to a PC to access the files proved impossible, so I ended up taking the SD card out and reading it off a card reader (glad I didn't glue on the cover!). The audio quality is not bad. Not great, but usable.I can see having audio recording being a bonus if you want to record something such as a lecture and don&#8217;t want to carry along a recorder.

It is very short - the total length of the cable is about 4 inches.The advantage is that since it is so compact and comes in a plastic holder, you can easily keep this with you with your keys (or hang it onto your backpack, etc.). But, since many powerbanks come with attached cords these days, I can't recall not having access to a cable when I needed it when not at home. At home I have dozens of cables so having one on my keychain is not much of an advantage.Given the price this is an average value.

While the solar charging feature has some limitations, it offers an alternative approach that is unique and unlike any other powerbank I've used.The device itself is a bit on the large size, measuring about 3 inches wide and 5.5 inches long. However, it's only about a half inch thick, so it's not what I'd consider to be ungainly (although certainly not nearly as compact as a conventional 5000mAh powerbank). The larger size is needed to support the solar panel.The build quality is very good. It's billed as being rain-proof, but not waterproof. In other words, getting some water on it is not a problem, but it's not something that can be fully submersed in water and survive.It has two USB output ports, both rated at 1A. The ports are covered with a silicon cap to keep out water and dust. The device itself is wrapped in a \"shock absorbing\" case (basically a thick rubber-like coating) that gives it a decent measure of bump and bruise protection. However, as expected, the solar panel that covers the full front of the powerbank is not protected, so you still need to take some measure of care with this.The overall design is pretty nice looking, with light blue accents and a black front and back. The caps covering the ports are anchored into the case so they can't get lost. It also has the usual \"gas gauge\" to show the charge level left (series of 4 LEDs) and a low-powered, but still useful flashlight. It comes with the usual assortment of connectors/adapters plus a very nice metal hook (spring loaded) so it can be easily clipped and unclipped to a backpack (or pretty much anything with a loop). That's a useful feature considering that this is a good device to have when camping.The solar panel is not intended to be the primary method of recharging, but rather be used in circumstances where you don't have access to a USB charge port. The instructions warn about leaving this in the sun for too long, which is (I assume) due to the fact that it has a Li-ion battery in it, and lithium batteries do not like to get hot.But even if heat were not an issue, it's not very practical to rely on just solar recharging since it is very slow. It took me a few hours to get this solar charged from the 75% level to the 100% level. Still, if solar is the only option you have (such as if you're camping) having a solar panel - even a slow one - is the difference between getting some power or none at all.The 5000mAh capacity and the 1A output make this suitable mainly for phones and small devices rather than tablets.>>>>UPDATE:  The manufacturer contacted me about the above statement and said that the output power is 2A if only one USB outlet is used. That makes the power output better suited to a tablet, but I still feel that a 5000mAh capacity powerbank is not an ideal choice for a tablet. Given the inefficiency of using a powerbank of any type, 5000mAh will not provide for a full charge on many tablets.  For me, the minimum capacity for a tablet powerbank is 8000mAh and, ideally 10,000mAh or more.All in all, it's a very handy device, and brings some unique features to the powerbank table.

Depending on how you feel about the light display, this can be either be a unique speaker or something that&#8217;s a poor value.Full review: This takes the typical mini bluetooth speaker a step further by building in a light display that can be tied to the music being played.My initial impression was very favorable &#8211; it feels solid and well-built. It&#8217;s all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality. It is also very well packaged, which is a departure from the usual &#8220;just toss it in a box&#8221; approach that&#8217;s typically seen. Unfortunately, the brief user guide that comes with it is very sparse and doesn&#8217;t really go through the product features or explain them very well. A better guild should have been included given the price point. Also included in the box is a cable (more on that later) and AC plug adapter for recharging, and a very nice cloth carry bag.The sound quality is excellent. The upper and mid-ranges are clear; there&#8217;s ample bass that doesn&#8217;t sound muddy or boomy; and unlike other bluetooth speakers the volume range is excellent &#8211; you can really blare this puppy! Zero complaints about the sound quality be it in bluetooth mode or direct wired mode.The built-in battery is 1300mAh which gives it a longer run time than pretty much any other speaker I&#8217;ve used. Excellent!The user interface is tied to the remote. I don&#8217;t like that since I&#8217;m prone to losing remotes. Granted, this has a slot for storing the remote but should you lose it you&#8217;ve also lost pretty much all functionality from the speaker since there are zero controls on the speaker itself. For me, that&#8217;s a major negative.The remote is small and thin, with well-marked buttons that provide a good amount of tactile feedback. No complaints about the remote &#8211; I just find it problematic that it is a mandatory item to use for speaker control.In addition to the remote you can download an app for iOS or Android for control options. I found the app unwieldy to use versus the remote, but it&#8217;s an option, and also serves as a &#8220;backup&#8221; should you lose the remote.As is usually the case with recent bluetooth speakers, zero problems pairing this with a device. The operating range is also very good with zero dropouts at 20+ feet.You can also direct-connect the speaker to a device, but instead of using a standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord, you have to use a cord (which is supplied) that has a 3.5mm plug on one end, and a mini USB plug on the other. That&#8217;s not a problem except for the fact that you have to remember to bring that cable along &#8211; a traditional 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord (of which I have a bunch of) won&#8217;t work.The advantage to the unique cable is that it can also be used as a charging cable (the included cable has 2 ends: one is a standard USB plug; the other is the 3.5mm plug). So, while it is unique, it means you only need to carry one cord to both charge and direct-connect.The light show is what really sets this apart from other speakers. That&#8217;s hard to judge in terms of value. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care much for it. Yes, it was fun for a short time, but I use speakers for the benefit of my ears, not my eyes. After a few minutes of playing with it, I turned it off (in addition to a variety of lighting options, it can also be turned off completely).So, if you find the lights distracting or unwelcome, you can turn them off but you&#8217;re paying a lot more for a speaker than you should &#8211; there are a number of bluetooth speakers that sound as good as this at far lower price points since they don&#8217;t include the light show.My ratings:Build quality = 5Sound quality = 5Instructions = 2User interface = 2Direct connect approach = 3Overall value = 5 (if you&#8217;re into a light show); 2 (if you just like to listen to speakers)Overall rating = 4. It is worth considering, but if you&#8217;re main goals for a speaker are good build quality and good sound, you can accomplish those goals by spending less than what this costs.[Sample provided for review]","overall":4.0,"summary":"Great sound; difficult user interface; uncertain value","unixReviewTime":1398729600,"reviewTime":"2014-04-29T00:00:00"}

It&#8217;s a three outlet surge protector that plugs directly into the wall, plus it has two USB ports for plugging in anything that charges from a USB cable. That combo has been done before, but this also includes two fold-out holders for phones (or other small devices). The holders extend sort of like wings from the side, and avoid having to put the phone on the floor while it&#8217;s charging. Nice idea!The build quality is pretty good. It&#8217;s all plastic, but feels pretty sturdy. On the back of the unit there&#8217;s a 3-prong post that plugs into the top outlet of a dual wall outlet, plus a plastic stability post that plugs into the bottom outlet. It also has a screw that threads into the center outlet cover screw to hold it firmly in place.I found it fits best in terms of looking flush to the wall if I removed the wall outlet cover.The downside is that it covers a dual wall outlet but only provides three surge-protected outlets, so you only really realize a gain of one outlet. The outlets are close together and don&#8217;t allow you to plug in more than two devices if they have a &#8220;wall wort&#8221; on the end. A better design would have been to space the outlets out more.The plastic &#8220;wings&#8221; allow it to hold a device that&#8217;s about three inches wide. It is a bit constrained in terms of depth &#8211; the bottom portion of the holder is only about 3/4 inch wide. Items thicker than 3/4 inch can be held, but they won&#8217;t be very secure. It&#8217;s best used for devices such as phones, iPods, or even small point and shoot cameras. The wings are too small to deal with any type of tablet.

This charger stands out by having the most compact footprint of any other Qi charger I&#8217;ve tried.I was really surprised at how small it is. It measures about 2.5 inches in diameter and is about 2 inches tall. It takes up very little counter space, which is a major plus since I leave my Q1 charger plugged in all the time on my kitchen counter, and pop my phone on it when I get home.The top has a non-skid coating on the charge surface so it holds the phone without any sliding. It also has a non-slip coating on the base which is excellent &#8211; it does not budge a bit even if it&#8217;s pushed with some force.The top can also be rotated so that you can choose between having the charge surface be horizontal or at an angle. I&#8217;m using this for phone charging so I keep it in horizontal mode but, if I were to use this for a tablet, the angled mode would be helpful. The angled mode would also be useful if you wanted to use the phone while it is being charged.It comes with a USB cable and a plug for the outlet. The plug is a bit on the large side (about 1.75 inches long and 1.5 inches wide) but it&#8217;s thin enough so that it does not block any other outlets when plugged into the wall.There&#8217;s an indicator light that shows power on and whether it is charging. The light is easily seen but not blinding.The build quality seems pretty good. The only quibbles I have is that the rotation (switching it from horizontal to angled mode) is sort of balky, and the USB port is not anchored as good as it could be.Performance (in terms of charge time) seems to be on a par with other Qi chargers. It's a slower charge than direct-connecting the phone to the wall, and it puts out some heat while charging. Again, those issues are found in any Qi charger.If you&#8217;re looking for a small Qi charger this is well worth considering. The build quality issues knock it down to 4.5 stars, but I&#8217;ll round up since the size is so convenient and the non-slip coating works so well.NOTE: Keep in mind that your phone (or tablet) must be Qi capable in order to use this charger.

It measures about 1.75 in diameter and is just under 2 inches long. Very cute design &#8211; looks sort of like a jet engine. The build quality feels very solid.

But, the bass is impressive &#8211; not what I would call &#8220;room shaking&#8221; but certainly far better than expected, and on a par with some larger speakers I&#8217;ve used. Again, with the caveat of its size, the sound quality is quite good.The size makes it perfect for a phone.

It&#8217;s very lightweight and I didn't see how it could actually hold a phone in place. Surprisingly, it really does work well!There are two micro suction pads. One is on the base, which holds the stand in place on a desk (or any other flat surface); the other pad is on the holding arm. It comes with a plastic protector film on both pads which you need to peel off before use. Be careful peeling it off &#8211; it&#8217;s stuck on firmly and you don&#8217;t want to damage the suction pad.It holds surprisingly tight. You have to push the base pretty firmly to get it to move. On the downside, when it does break free when pushed hard, it breaks free all at once. So, when testing it out to see how much force it will resist, don&#8217;t have your phone on it or the phone will go flying (learned that the hard way).The top pad can be used as-is to hold a phone or other small device.. There&#8217;s zero residue left on the phone when you remove it from the pad.The build quality is decent. It&#8217;s all plastic, but it&#8217;s nicely formed. Unfortunately, it has a glossy finish which looks great when clean, but is a huge fingerprint magnet.It also includes a small cradle with hooks at the base to hold items you don&#8217;t want to stick directly to the pad. You stick the cradle on the pad, and then put your device in the cradle. The hooks will hold a device up to  inch wide very well, and can be used for thicker devices if you don&#8217;t mind that the device won&#8217;t seat well in the cradle.The pads do get gummed up with dust and dirt and loose their grip power. They have to be cleaned regularly (the manufacturer suggests using adhesive tape to pull off the accumulated gunk). That&#8217;s something to keep in mind &#8211; without cleaning, it won&#8217;t work well.The holding power is 100% steady for lightweight items. I had zero failures when holding items as heavy as 6 ounces. Heavier items can be held as well &#8211; I was able to get this to hold items as heavy as one pound, but the holding power is not maintained, and the object falls off after a while. The amount it can hold is also based on where the center of gravity is. For example, a short piece of pipe weighing 16 ounces stayed put for hours; a tall sheet of plastic weighing half as much fell off after a few minutes.In practical terms, this will hold pretty much any phone very well. I&#8217;d also trust it to hold a 5 inch tablet provided that I used care when touching the screen while the tablet was on the mount. I would not trust it with a larger tablet not so much due to the weight, but the fact that the center of gravity is too high for it to be stable. Again, everything is with the caveat that the holding surfaces are clean.Although it&#8217;s not cheap, it&#8217;s a novel approach to holding a phone or small tablet on your desk for ease of use and for watching video.

Once you have all your names correctly vocalized in your phone, you choose `Bluetooth' in your phone `settings' to synchronize and you are off!I really didn't pay much attention to the style of the Discovery 925, but it is smaller than most and isn't obnoxious looking.

I found no interruption, even when in the bathroom with several walls and appliances in between. This is obviously much better than holding a phone with your hand. The earpiece comes already paired with the USB link. Pairing to your phone is just as easy as any Bluetooth. Tapping on/off is simple as well, however voice activation does not work on all phones.

The camera and flash are given a wider window for easier cleaning for dust and debris and for picture clarity.

Each one represents 25% battery life. My battery came fully charged, but when empty, will take from seven to ten hours to fully charge.It's a good idea to let your battery go down to about 10%-15%, but no lower.

Two cables to do all of that instead of an entire package of misfit accessories.There are two out USB ports on the top side. It's nice to have the voltage capability easily readable. One USB output is 5V-1A and the other is a 5V-2A. The 5V-2A is for charging larger devices like your iPad, Tablet, etc. And the other USB port is for charging just about anything else. The difference is significant in charging time.The instructions (and the top of the Amazon page) show you what devices can be charged. It's virtually unlimited.

Again, all the functions are slightly raised as well as well-lit so it is safe to operate.The sound is as good as your speakers.  Control your music, answer phone calls, adjust the volume while charging your device all at the same time.Of course, you want to set up everything before you start driving, but once you've mastered the easy touch, everything is possible.  For the price, this makes a great permanent device for your vehicle and a great gift.  It is easily pulled out and hidden as well.  It's easy, multi-purpose and amazing.  Well worth the price.

First the battery pack is 10.2 ounces (that's fairly light and typical of a battery pack).  It measures (1\" X 2.5\" X 5\") which is also very convenient and typical.  However, the `view' level of charge is extremely simple.  I like the battery packs that actually give you a digital read-out or a 20% incremental reading.  This battery has one light which shows, `Green' is full, `Blue' is about two-thirds, `Red' is about one-third and `no light' means no power.  My battery came fully charged, but when empty, it took about eight to ten hours to fully charge (the instructions claim eleven hours, but I am guessing that's from zero).It's a good idea to let your battery go down to about 10%-15%, but no lower. This keeps the battery life lasting and it already claims to recharge over 500 times!  You charge through the included cord with the micro USB port to a regular USB that can be charge through your computer or through a wall outlet.  If you use an adapter type device attachment for an electrical outlet you will get a faster charge.There are two out USB ports on the same top side. The grey on grey is a little tough to read, but one is a 5V/1A for smartphones and the other is a 5V/2.1A for tablets (or simply a faster charge for anything).  The difference is significant in charging time.You can charge virtually anything. Just some geek info: \"mAh\" means `Milli-ampere hour'. It's the rating of the battery. It means your battery is of a 13,500 mAh rating.I have an iPhone 4S and it will charge almost seven times.  It charged my iPad mini and my iPhone 4S together in about (5.5) hours from a starting point of 15% full. I would suggest charging one device at a time to be sure of a full charge in a faster time.  If overnight, use them both.The battery is a very high quality \"Lithium-ion polymer\".  There is no stated claim that you can never over-charge or damage the battery or your device.  Having said that, with all the batteries I've used, I think that is a rare possibility.  There is also a nice black felt pouch included for carry.  It's really not the most aesthetically pleasing battery or fancy, but for 13,500 mAh of power and the price, it is a true bargain.

There is a wafer thin remote that only adjusts the volume, bass, treble and EQ (resets to factory equalizer setting) as well as the power.  The back of the gdock has two Bass Ports and that is what gives it such a strong firm bass.  You'll want these exposed in the back and not on the bottom of the unit.The gdock is attractively sleek with a black fabric finish.  The docks rotate and lock from 38 degrees to 50 degrees depending on how you want your device to look.  You can even choose two positions to set your entire gdock - although it's only a matter of an inch or two differences.  The power light is a tiny blue LED and is hard to see unless it is very dark.The power connector is one of those double cables with a black box the size of a cigarette case, but that's fairly minor.  You can charge your device and battery when the gdock is plugged into a wall source, but it won't charge your device (phone) from just the gdock battery.  The back has a battery door for the OPTIONAL lithium battery which is sold separately.  I did not get one, but it is supposed to last up to six hours.If you want to plug another device into your gdock, there is the standard 3.5mm insert in the back.

The main grip for your phone is expandable, so it is likely to take just about any sized phone (up to 3.3 inches).  This grip is then attached to the main mount.  The main mount consists of the circular plastic that attaches to your windshield (or dashboard) and the circular plastic that holds your phone.  These two are connected by a ball valve that rotates 360 degrees.  In fact, you can rotate your phone 360 degrees horizontally and vertically to make the perfect viewing fit.Suction cup grips have always been a nuisance for me.  You hit a bump in the road and everything drops to the floor making for a hazardous situation.  The \"Press-n-Twist Lock\" powerful suction cup mount usually attaches securely.  You can try to slightly wet the suction mount on your windshield or for the most egregious situation, simply glue it to your windshield.  (You can scrape it off later if you need to).

This could have simply been my headset as no other reviews seem to have had this problem.The fit is very comfortable as the ear buds are angled in the perfect manner to fit without falling out. The little black handle on the connecting strand was easy to control simply by touch. They were volume up, volume down and the Multi-function button. It does allow you to: Answer a phone call, end a phone call or reject a call. You can redial the last number with one touch and transfer between your headset and cell and voice dial (which is cool).The sound was very well balanced, but the loudness was medium and I had my phone volume up to the maximum. There are other Bluetooth ear buds/headphones on the market, but of the two I have owned, they both have the same issue - low volume. For the price, I can't say they are a great deal, but if you want low-volume headphones, then you may like these.

This is based on the sound from my iPhone 4S.  Most equivalent sets give a good high and midrange, but stink with bass. The `Aleratec' manages to really give a solid bass boost and a bass drum feel that is perfectly synced and balanced with the mid and high range tones.  The drivers really must be high premium.  The acoustic sound and precise bass will make you toss out any other set of ear buds.  Only a good headset around your ears can produce a better sound.Unlike other ear buds, the 3.5mm jack is set at a right angle to prevent accidental pull-outs.  The bright red cord is flat, not round, so you won't get all tangled up like with typical ear buds; i.e., iPhone ear buds.  This is a nice design correction.The in-line microphone is an easy click to switch to phone calls and switching between music and calls is easy and feels intuitive.  When a phone call comes in, the sound of voices sound normal; not too tinny or bassy. The `noises isolation' actually works very well with the exclusionary action of outside noises.You know those Apple ear buds that always fall out of your ear?  These fits in your ears perfectly without fear of falling out while running or biking.  The simply design just works - these inventors know their stuff.The nicely packaged box (this is a great gift for birthdays, holidays or, um, new dates) also comes with extra ear plugs Gels (S, M, L) and a nice black felt bag for all.

If you're looking at all the dozens of Bluetooth portable speakers out there, you may want to take a serious look at the \"ECANDY Bluetooth speaker\".It charges with a 3.7 V built-in aluminum battery in about 1-2 hours through an enclosed USB cable.  It easily pairs quickly to just about any device.  The speaker will last up to four hours!  For sound clarity, it is one of the best, with a punchy but not boomy bass.  The midranges are delightfully crisp and the trebles are distinct.  Sometimes, I hear instruments I've never heard before.  The volume can be loud enough to be used outdoors.You also have the option of hooking this up directly to your device (mobile phone, etc.) with the enclosed 3.5mm cable.  This speaker is actually perfect for an office space.  When a phone call comes in, the speaker quickly goes dormant and you can answer your call.Not all is perfect with this model however.  All the control buttons are on the bottom - in fact the unit rests on the three control buttons, meaning you have to turn the unit upside down to work them properly.  The arrangement is odd as well.  One button is for pairing, pause and play.  Another is for fast forward (to next song) and volume up.  The third is return (to previous song) and volume down.  I can think of an easier way to combine these functions.  The functions are visible on the top and bottom of the unit, but they are silver on silver and black on black, making reading a bit difficult.Having said that; for the price of the speaker and the absolutely fantastic sound quality, I have to say this is the best portable Bluetooth speaker I have found to date.

The two speakers are 1-1/2&#8221; wide (40mm) with 6-watt drivers.  Most Bluetooth&#8217;s are in the 2-4 watt range, so you get more power.

It is not a wimpy external battery and is meant for big charging jobs - anywhere. This 14,000mAh PowerPak is the most powerful out there, but with new features.The battery pack is about the size of two iPhone5 smartphones and weighs as much. However, the `view' level of charge is extremely simple. I like the battery packs that actually give you a digital read-out or a 20% incremental reading, but this battery pack gives you four easily read blue LED lights representing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% charging indicators. My battery came fully charged, but when empty, it took about nine hours to fully charge (this basically means an overnight charge through your USB computer port or a slightly faster charge through an Apple electrical socket accessory).It's a good idea to let your battery go down to about 25%, but no lower. This keeps the battery life lasting and it already claims to recharge over 500 times! Remembering that this is a POWERPAK with no frills, there is only a Micro-USB to standard USB cord included. No other accessories.All ports are covered with a tight-fitting waterproof cover. NewTrent states that this battery can last in three feet underwater for up to three hours. That means you can drop it into a pool or on the beach and be assured that if you rescue it in a reasonable amount of time, you are safe. No other batteries can claim that.There are two out USB ports on the same top side (2.1A and 1A - 5V each). I have to be honest in that although these covers seem to be waterproof, I would never unnecessarily test them. I do trust New Trent's claim however.You can charge virtually anything. Just some geek info: &#34;mAh&#34; means `Milli-ampere hour'. It's the rating of the battery. It means your battery is of a 14,000 mAh rating. With this battery, you can expect to charge an average smartphone (I have an iPhone 4S and can charge it about six times easily to 100%). When I charged my iPad 2, it took about two full iPhone 4S charges away. In essence, in my case, I can fully charge an iPhone 4S and my iPad 2 almost three times - not quite. But you will get a slightly faster charge if you do them alternatively, one by one. Charging times will vary depending on your charge amount required and how many devices and what types you are charging.

Also, a symbol shows up when using the tiny flashlight and when using one or both of the USB out ports, these also show up as 5V2.1A and 5V1A OUT (which is really just a nice feature).I would suggest looking at all types of power banks/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! This will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery.

I would not be afraid of dropping this in the water or on the concrete &#8211; it is that durable.The left top button pressed once gives you the amount of power left.  There are three green bars, telling you if there is 33%, 66% or 100% battery charge left.  Press the same buttons for two seconds and a bright pin-point red laser light appears.  The right button, when pressed will give you a white LED light.  When pressed for two seconds, it displays an SOS mode light.  The light is not very bright. The laser works for a good distance, but the white light is really for small spaces and limited light range.There is a thin black plastic flap on top that covers the charging input (Micro-USB) port and the input for the USB charging port.  The enclosed USB-Micro-USB port cord is a flat non-tangle cord.  This is a God-send for all of us who have had to untangle circular cords, such as the standard Apple ear-buds.The battery has 5200mAh of power, which I was able to fully charge my iPhone from about 20% (the lowest before you get a power warning).  It charged my iPad2 about 50% from the same 20%.  It&#8217;s not a powerful battery, but for its size, it is very convenient when your phone is very low on power and you are not somewhere you can simply plug it into a PC USB port or a USB port adapter for an electrical outlet.This is an ideal small multi-device for fishing, camping or even in your glove compartment for road emergencies.

The other side of the unit contains the charging micro-USB port, a 3.5 mm internal female plug for using outside music sources (other phones or tablets).One of the nicest things is the inclusion of the TF Card mini slot.

There is a wafer sized remote control if you don't like the felt-tip short-pens.The On/Off button is tiny on top and you need to see it - not feel it.Pros:It looks great with a red display showing FM or Bluetooth mode, icons for song forward/backward, volume up/down, pause/play and alternate from Bluetooth/FM.When the unit pairs or goes to FM, a voice clearly tells you - I like that.The felt-tip short-pen is handy.The speakers are stereo left and right with another middle speaker on top that brings out more of the bass sound.The lithium battery is easily installed.There is a charging cord that runs from your PC USB to the unit.There is a 3.5mm female jack for external sources of music with appropriate cord included.  There is a USB port on top of the unit for accessibility to other electronic devises.There is a micro-USB port (TF Slot) that allows you to store and play as many songs as you can depending on much memory the card has - this is a big plus, I think.

It is easy to hold and pretty comfortable in the hand. The weighted base keeps the phone from tipping over or sliding around on my desk. Now I can type on my keyboard and hold the phone up with my shoulder to have full use of both hands, unlike trying to hold a cell phone the same way that is nearly impossible without dropping it.I have the iPod Touch and an iPad, but I am using it only with my Droid Smartphone since I don't have a clue what to download for my Apple products (but I bet \"there is an app for that\").

I was somewhat concerned after reading some of the negative reviews but I can honestly say connectivity and clarity have not been a problem at all for me. I am using it with my iPhone 4S. First thing I should mention that is packed and presently nicely in a very thick plastic box. The instruction book is extremely thick, but it comes in 10 different languages and the actual instructions to follow are only about 20 pages and that includes pictures. Comes with 4 types of multi country AC adapters in case you travel to foreign countries that use different type of voltage plugs. Two universal dock adapters and a Micro-USB/USB cable if you wish to charge the unit via your computer.The base has some weight to it and will sit securely in place. I got the soft Black Touch which is like a soft rubber and it feels soft and silky smooth and can easily be wiped cleaned. It stated in the handbook that it takes about 2 to 3 hours to charge the unit 100%, but it took about 1  until the white LED turned off telling me the handset was completely charged. Paring was a breeze - just press the MFB button for 2 seconds on the handset and go to your bluetooth menu on your iPhone. My iPhone found it and paired with the MM03i automatically with no code. You actually can program up to 4 Bluetooth devices according to the instructions, but it will only automatically reconnect the last devices connected in its memory.I use a case with my iPhone and do not like the idea of removing it. My phone fit perfectly fine in it's case and I had no connection issues if I used the base without a dock adapter. Using the \"+\" , \"-\" and \"MFB\" buttons pretty much allow you to use all the functions as you would on your iPhone. You can reject a call, control the volume, hold a call, redial last number call and even use voice command. I use Siri a lot and all you have to do is hold the \"+\" button for two sections and she will pop up and await your instruction.You also can choose a different ringtone. There are a total of 15 in all. Since I am using the handset in office, I set the volume at the lowest possible setting because some of the ringtones can ring quite loudly. In regards to clarity, I have had no complaints. Callers have heard me clearly and I have heard them fine. The handset feels comfortably against my ear and there is no hand or ear fatigue.I would like to mention that in the instructions it states the MM03i enables Bluetooth connection with any laptop, desktop (Mac or PC) to work with Skype, Google Talk or other VOIP services. I don't have Bluetooth Wireless Technology on my PC, but I thought it might be important to mention.The only negative feature is that it is hard to tell the difference between the receiver and earpiece, the both look identical. I would try to answer a call holding the wrong end to my ear. Sometimes instead of thinking the unit is charging I come to found out I put the wrong end where it is suppose to charge. Even though is will not sit perfectly flush when the right end is not in the right hole, it would have been nice to have some kind of marking showing the top of the handset.Overall this is a really neat product for Smartphone users.

I believe what you are using as wallpaper reflects how the touch screen is going to look when in use.

Other ones I have seen are extremely large and look awkward to wear.  I prefer boom arm microphones rather than the ones that the mic is part on the unit and sits on your cheek closer to your ear.  It has been my experience that bluetooth microphones that sit back further from your mouth seem to pick up a lot of background noise and your voice does not transmit as clearly.  The etyBLU headset comes with a flexible boom arm that can be adjusted closer to your mouth to so you can be heard without background noises, and it comes with a bi-directional microphone so your voice is clearly heard.It can be worn for long periods of time without ear fatigue.  It is extremely lightweight and balances perfectly in my ear.  The earpiece sits deep into the ear and it comes with 5 different size ear tips so you have the best comfortable fit.  The volume could be better, even when I have it turned up to the maximum setting I have a hard time hearing the other person on the line sometimes.  For this reason, I like using the foam ear tip which molds completely around your ear canal.  I tell tell it is a snug fit because when I wear dangle earrings and they smack against the boom arm, it sounds like I am in a tunnel and the \"clunk\" is deep in my ear (hope that makes sense).  Comes with two different sized windscreens to block out air currents if you are in a windy environment.  You do have the option to upgrade to a custom fit earmold directly from the manufacturer.  You can have a custom fit ear mold made from impressions taken of your ear canal.  They look and remind me of hearing aids.  They sell for $100 and you can order and schedule your appointment at the manufacturer's website.I prefer to just wear the headset without the ear loop, but if you rather use your headset with an over the ear loop, it comes with an attachable wire ear hook.  One really nice feature about the earhook is that you can adjust the length by sliding it up or down.  Also enclosed is two replaceable wax filters and filter removal tool.Comes a (very short) micro-USB cable to charge via computer or compatible device.  Since it is so short, it might make it a nuisance for people who only have USB slot located in back of their computer.  Instead I use my 12Vcar multi power socket outlet that comes with a USB slot to charge it.  Since I use this headset mostly with my Droid cell phone, I also use the AC wall power micro USB adapter that came with my phone to charge it was well.  It took me about 3 hours to get a full charge.  You know when it is fully charged with the LED light turns from yellow to blue.Pairing was a breeze; I was able to pair it with my Droid and Palm Pre within seconds.  You can connect up to 8 devices!  All functions are controlled by pressing the Multi-Function Button located in the front of the unit which is very easy to operate and find (silver button). States talk time is 7 hours and standby is 100 hours (little over 4 days).  I found myself recharging it only after using it every three days, which really is not very much time since I turn it off after every use.  So I have to take away a star for its battery life.  Other than the battery, this headset is the top of the line for that multi-tasker.Comes with a 2-year warranty.","overall":4.0,"summary":"Finally a Decent Bluetooth Headset with a Boom Arm.","unixReviewTime":1285027200,"reviewTime":"2010-09-21T00:00:00"}

So far we have used the sCharger-5 in our boat, convertible and out camping.  I know there will be hundreds of other uses for it.  The included storage/carrying bag is a great way for carrying small accessories such as cords and protecting the solar panel while traveling.  The solar panel is lightweight and folds in half.  I also acquired the sCharger grip tripod (you can get directly from Suntactics website).  The tripod is ideal for keeping the solar panel off the ground and keeps it completely open to get the most sunlight.You can even use the solar panel as you are using the device.  Just make sure you have DIRECT sunlight since solar panels use their own charge and redistribute that charge to your device.  They actually are not recharging your device.  The sunlight is recharging the solar panel and the solar panel is then using it's charge to \"rejuvenate\" your battery.  An example of charging time, it brought back my dead iPhone 5 to a full charge in about 1 hour and 45 minutes.With solar batteries you no longer have to worry about being near a power source or have to make sure to have plenty of external battery packs charged.

The Jabra CRUISER2 has open new doors for me!  I am extremely impressed with on how clear and loud I can be heard, even with my window slightly opened.  At first I found myself yelling at the speaker until I was too that I was too loud and hurting their ears.  I then lowered my voice to a normal talking level and I was still heard clearly as if I was standing right next to the person.  I have been even told that I sound better speaking on the Jabra Speakerphone than on my actual cellphone itself - now that's impressive!I am using it with my Motorola Droid smartphone.  Pairing was so simple, it did not even ask for the pin code.  A female voice talks you through the steps.  It was up and running in seconds.  During the initial setup, all my contacts transferred to the unit.  However, when I am receiving a call it does not announce the callers names, instead it announces the digits of their phone number.  All functions answer/end call, redial and voice dial)are pretty much done using one button, the call button.  The unit is slim and small but I wish the bracket was shorter or constructed differently.  The length of the bracket is pretty long.  Since it is so long I can not place it in the middle of my sun-visor because it interferes with the hard plastic cover lighted mirror.  Because of this, I have to clip the it to the end of the visor, which makes it difficult to see and use the buttons on the side of the unit.In regards to transmitting the call through your radio, it has it's good and bad points. I find that the FM button is too small and difficult to find since it sits n the side on the speakerphone.  Maybe if it was placed on the front of the unit it would of been easier to turn on.  It is hard to find a station without any static, but you can easily tune to different frequencies by using the volume up and down buttons while in FM mode.  I have mine set to 88.3.  I live in a very rural area and no radio stations use that frequency.  If I have the volume turned down at a normal level (medium-low) I can not hear the caller clearly.  If I have the volume turned up higher, I then hear constant static in the background.  I don't believe this is any fault of Jabra, it is just the frequencies I can only use in my area.  Even though I can hear a faint static using the FM transmitter, I prefer to use it instead of just using the CRUISER2 speakers.  The speaker volume on the CRUISER2 is not as loud as I would like it to be.One great feature is that I do not have to turn the unit off manually.  Once I end a call and walk out of my vehicle, the unit will turn itself in standby position (no lights) after 10 minutes.  Once I go back in my truck, all I have to do is hit the call button and it is back up and ready for use. Battery life is quite long.Overall, I give it 4 stars for it's ability to allow callers to hear me loud and clear without screaming.  It loses 1 star for the unit's lack of adjusting or changing the clip-on bracket, as well as the placement of the FM and ON/Off buttons.Make sure to visit Jabra's website for more information and instructions.UPDATE:  It has been 4 weeks since I have had recharged the unit, and it is still going strong.  On average I have been using least 90 minutes a day on talk time and an average of 2 hours in standby (on) mode .","overall":4.0,"summary":"I Can be Heard Loud and Clear","unixReviewTime":1291334400,"reviewTime":"2010-12-03T00:00:00"}

I previously was using theJabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphonebut sadly had to give it up to my dear husband who refused to use a headset.  I did not mind because this way I was able to acquire the newer model.  The Jabra Freeway is the newest model since the Cruiser 2.  It is a tad bit larger, but offers a few more features such as automatic turn on and off with the built-in motion sensor, and acoustically optimized HD quality microphones and surround sound speakers.  You pretty much give all the commands by your voice.  For example when you call comes in, you can just say \"answer\" or \"ignore\".  If you want to make a call, just hit the \"Voice\" button once and say \"phone commands\", then say \"call &lt;John Doe> mobile\".  It is that easy.  That is one big difference between the Cruiser 2 and the Freeway.  With the Cruiser 2 you had to hold and count the seconds on the action button to make it do certain commands such as last redial or voice dial.  With the Freeway everything is done with the touch of one button and I don't have to hold it for 1, 2 or 3 seconds!I got so excited about talking about the actual usage of the speakerphone that I almost forgot to mention the setup.  I am using it with the Verizon iPhone 4G and setup with so simple it took less than one minute.  The automated programmed voice is very clear to hear and understand.  This is the first time I have had to actually turn the volume down on a speakerphone because it was too loud! The sound is crystal clear.  I really do not know how anyone can give this item a bad review unless it does not work with their particular brand of phone.  in regards to the FM transmitter functions, it works as well as other types of transmitters I have tried.  There is NO wireless FM transmitter out there that is not going to be static free.  Think about, the only way is be able to be static free is to be directly plugged into your radio and not be \"wirelessly\".  This speakerphone will be primarily used for phone calls and not for my the FM transmitter.  I can hear perfectly loud and clear by the units speakers and have no need to be using it to play my iTunes music through it.  the speakers alone will be sufficient for me to hear my calls loud and clearly.Now lets get to the Voice Assist.  Forget about it.  Not worth it.  I did sign up for it since it is a free trial offer for one-year but I don't see any use for it.  I asked myself do I really need to urgently send someone a text message or post a status on Facebook?  Is it that important that I can't wait till I am out of the car and on my computer, iPad or iPhone.  I can wait - I am not that important to be posting about my life's every moment for all to know.  Also, what most might not realize is that you have to call a landline phone number that uses airtime off your cellular plan in order to use the Voice Assist.  Signing up was not as much of a hassle as some made it sound.  Just make sure to read the instructions on the Voice Assist website and you should have no problems.  You have to download the firmware upload and apply it, THEN enter your UPC code after the firmware update is applied.  This is for units purchased from Amazon ONLY.YOU WILL LOVE THIS SPEAKERPHONE.  I am curious to see what is next for Jabra since I can not imagine how something so perfect could be improved.  Well now that I think about it, maybe they will come up with \"Park Assist\" on their next units.  :-)EDIT:  I almost forgot to add one more thing.

I suggest to have a couple strips of scotch tape handy. Scotch tape works best to lift the screen protector back up instead of using your fingers or nails since that can leave finger prints and marks behind. Also, it works great to remove lint left behind that you might of missed after applying the screen protector. Just lift a corner of the screen protector back up and use the scotch tape to remove it.

Instead of using the enclosed cardboard card to squeegee the air bubbles out - I used a credit card, it slides across more easily.WOW I thought I was looking into an actual mirror.

In New York State you can get a ticket for just \"holding\" your cellphone!  With the Incredisonic IFM-500 I can use my iPhone 5 to listen to music, receive and make calls (even use Siri for voice dialing), charge my iPhone, control volume and even change FM frequencies all at my fingertips without picking up my iPhone.Paring was incredibll simple.  My iPhone 5 quickly recognized the unit and paired it without inputting any information or pressing buttons.  One bit of advice however, make sure to turn off ANY other Bluetooth devices you may have on in your vehicle.  It will cause conflict issues if you have more than one Bluetooth device on at the same time and they may not work properly when you try to use them again.The LED lights are easy to read and use.  My iPhone went to sleep mode, but I still can use the pause, forward, rewind or phone controls on the Incredisonic IFM-500.To charge your phone, just plug your USB phone charger in the USB slot located on the side of the Incredisonic IFM-500.It loses a star because even though the instructions state the barrel can be twisted to adjust the fit inside the cigarette lighter socket, it fits loosely and the weight of my iPhone causes the unit to fall to the side.  Maybe it is my socket, but I ended up using some velcro to keep it in place.

I think it was because there is really no extra space surrounding the cutouts.  However, I only used on screen protector and did not waste any others in the process.The best way to apply screen protectors is to start out in an area that there will be no traffic such as people or pets around.  Make sure to clean the screen of your iPhone so there is no lint, fingerprints or smears left behind.  Have several pieces of scotch tape ready.  After you have lined up and placed the screen protector, remove the top film and squeegee out the air bubbles with a card credit.  There will probably be a few air bubbles or a piece of lint that sneaked in.  Use pieces of scotch tape on the corners to lift up the section that the lint is located and use another piece of scotch tape to remove it.  Gently reapply the screen protector back on and squeegee and rub it back down. You may have to repeat this process until all tiny lint particles are removed.  Seriously, you do not have to waste screen protectors because lint got underneath it, just use scotch tape to remove the dirt and lint.  One screen protector can last me 6 to 12 months before I have to replace it.After people have seen my iPhone 5 they are impressed how they can not tell I have a screen protector on it since there are no air or lint bubbles.

So when he saw this ZeroLemon 7000 mah battery for his Galaxy S3 on Amazon, he was all for it.He realized going in for a battery this size, there would be some size to it and his normal case would never fit, but it did come with a soft plastic back for the phone.  When it arrived he was amazed that it was more like a really large size battery piggy backed on a normal battery.  The case fit on super easy and is a soft plastic which adds much more grip than the stock shiny plastic back that came stock from Samsung.  It looks like it will absorb a fall, but as to how long the case lasts is an unknown.  By the way, he is not adventurous enough to actually drop the S3 to test the back's protection.So he got it all charged and ran it for 24 hours under normal use, including some WiFi tethering and music streaming.  Really a normal day for him.  There was still 48% of the battery left after 24 hours.  For an S3, that is amazing.  Yes, he said it adds some weight and thickness to the phone, but it still fits in his car holder and he just carries it in his pants pocket so it fits fine.So now he is totally in love with this battery and singing its praises.  Then he took a little trip and clicked on the GPS for navigation.  Hmmm, no satellite lock!  Well, S3's are notoriously known for bad for GPS, but  he has always been able to get a lock outside.  He went through possible fixes on line and tightened all the screws, pulled the SIM card yada..yada..yada, but still no satellite lock.  He was not even thinking it was a battery issue until he thought about the size of the battery.  He looked on line and found the GPS antenna placement was in the top left side of the phone looking from the back and it is partially covered by the battery now.Still not wanting to give up the battery, he switched to his old battery and got an instant satellite lock.

It keeps the phone displayed nicely so he see messages coming in, but it also has a cool little pen holder (no pen included) with a blue LED lighting the spot.

First off, it stores a lot of power.  I have used other units that store power for charging cell phones, but I usually get one charge out of it before I have to recharge the unit.  Not a bad thing, but the flexibility is not there if you have a 4G power drainer and you are not going to be around electricity or a car for a few days.  Ok, if you have a Galaxy S3 or S4 or comparable you need to charge it every 12 hours if you have anything turned on.With the Power Tank I was able to charge my S4 about 4 times before needing recharged.  Not bad and nice to have the option especially when I have to be in long all day meetings and forgot to charge my phone the night before.  With the smaller units, I would have had to recharge it as well as the phone that night and I am not always good at remembering to do that.Now, the game changer with the Power Tank is it will charge an IPAD!  I got 1 charge with the pad depleted to about 60% and enough to bring it from 50% to 80% the next night.  This just is not going to happen with another smaller charger.  So for me, worth every penny!The other reason it is a tank though, is it is a heavy and very solid little unit with a hard metal case.  This is not a pocket model and would definitely add some weight to your purse.  In a computer case or back pack though, probably not noticeable.  As for other thoughts, it has a flashlight of sorts with a couple white LED's which as a last resort might be handy, but not a real benefit.  I would rather use the phone LED.Why not 5 stars? It says to charge the unit until the 3 blue lights glow green.  I left this puppy charging 24 hours trying to get it to go green...it just stays blue.  So, sounds like a misprint to me.What would make it better? It delivers as promised, but I think it would be awesome to add a solar recharge option on the unit.  Honestly since this holds so much power, it takes a while to charge so getting the jump on it with solar would be great and this would be a fabulous option for hikers or outdoors folks who could go for ever on this.

Before I acquired the iPhone 5S I was using the Samsung Galaxy S4.  One of the many accessories I missed was the wireless charging capabilities the Galaxy S4 had.  You also were able to choose from so many different covers and cases that worked with the Qi receiver (wireless charging pad).  I checked what was out in the market for the iPhone 5 but nothing seemed to really \"fit\" what I was looking for until I had the opportunity to test the Unu Aero Wireless Charging Case and Pad.The case itself is soft to the touch and comes it two separate pieces.  It does a tiny bit of bulk and weight to the phone, but not too much to make much of a difference.  The case has raised buttons for the volume and power controls.  However, it has an open area for the mute switch.  Even though it does not have an open area in the bottom for the speakers, it  has two slots located on the front of the case for sound and microphone use.  The camera cutout on the back is quite large, so expect no interference troubles there.The receiver (Qi) pad is extremely lightweight and automatically begins charging you phone as soon as it makes connect with your phone.  Believe it or not, this charges faster the normal lightning cable.  I was so impressed with how fast it charges and how long it holds the charge, I ended up acquiring two additional charging pads to have in my office and another in my vehicle instead of using a lightning cable.  Keep in mind besides using the wireless pad to charge the phone,  you can always a  micro USB cable to charge the case as well in case of emergencies.  The only thing you really need to get use to is using a headset extension adapter.  Since the headphone jack sits far into case, a headphone plug will not be able to fit correctly.  I don't use the same headsets all the time, so I have to make it a point to remember to carry the included headphone jack adapter with me when I plan to use different headphones.One really great feature is the battery usage indicator located on the back of the case.  It has four tiny blue lights to tell you how much battery life is left.  It is pretty accurate too because I have the battery indicator on my phone and I am always comparing the two.When using it to sync to iTunes, you just need to use a micro USB cable instead of the Apple Lightning cable.  This way you don't have to take the case off.This is truly a terrific product and works great.  If you are interested in extra pads here is the link:uNu Aero Series Wireless Charging Pad (Single Mat). Like I mentioned before, I used one in my vehicle by placing it in one of the cubbyholes in my Dogde Durango - works great!UPDATE:Since I kept taking the case on and off to test and review other cases on my phone, I broke one of the tabs on my uNu Aero case and wanted to cry because this is my favorite and pretty much the case I use everyday.  I emailed customer service (services@myunu.com) and they quickly issued me a replacement.  So besides being a great wireless charging case, they have wonderful customer service as well.Sample provided for review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"A must have for the iPhone 5/5S - you will LOVE it!","unixReviewTime":1389052800,"reviewTime":"2014-01-07T00:00:00"}

That was the first indication this was not a normal little speaker. The sound just vibrated my hand and sounded like a much larger speaker. After putting it on the table it made a few more sounds and went right into the pairing mode and my phone connected right to it.Of course the first thing I did was find a song and crank it up until the family yells,\"Turn that thing down!\" two rooms away. Nice! Since it is made for phones and has a mic in it as well, I then called my unsuspecting spouse who said it sounded fine on the other end, but on my end it sounded great. Nice full bass tones and much preferred over the phone's speaker phone.The practical side of me then kicked as I thought what I would really use it for. If I had to do a long conference call I would use the MOSOUND in a heart beat. The sound would be very easy on the ears and would free me up to do other things, like shop Amazon, during those long pointless calls we all get sucked into. I think it would easily pick up my, \"uh huh\" and \"yes, of course I am listening.\"We connected both a Galaxy 3 and my iPhone to it with no problem.On a day to day basis though it will not see much phone time. I have better plans. Anyone with an iPad knows the speakers are less than amazing, pretty much useless.  To hear anything in a noisy environment you either need to use head phones, which mess my hair, ear buds that just bother me or cup your hand just right under the speaker to shoots the sound forward. The MOOUND has transformed my iPad to a great multimedia machine with out having to do any of the fore mentioned. I like laying in on a table next to me so it is aimed at my ear and I get great sound while no one else really hears much.In the car, it fits nicely in the cup holder that actually boosts the bass nicely and I don't have to mess around plugging the phone into the car radio.Comparing it to other wireless speakers I have to say price and size-wise it is a great deal. I do have a larger and much more expensive unit that sounds a bit better and louder, but it is not as practical for carrying around.

The iPhone 5 is super useful but it's a resource hog. The phone was made to sell, and customers liked the small profile and weight, not knowing they'd have to attach a battery cover if they want to use the phone much.This battery cover doesn't weigh much at all nor does it take much volume. It truly boggles the mind that one can't get a new iPhone with sufficient power. For the price, this deal is great - it more than doubles the power of the iPhone 5.As for safety in terms of protecting the iPhone from bumps, I think the battery cover gives only a little extra safety.

If I am within 250 feet of the wireless, no problem at all connecting.2) 3.5\" jack, I can connect this phone to stereo speakers or any headset that I want to for great stereo sound.3) FM Radio (must use headset). I have been able to get many stations clearly! (Better than on my desk set radio).4) Email setup - I was able to get on Gmail and Yahoo wonderfully with the built in email on the phone.5) The calendar/organizer - This is my FAVORITE feature of this phone because I can set alarms to go off during the day with the calendar and use my own voice memos to tell me what the appointment is for! This keeps me so organized!6) Notes and task list-This also keeps me organized with things that I need to do and notes as well.love all of the features and find it is fast and easy to use.

This phone is like having a secretary working for you. I also have a HTC Touch2 phone that is a touch phone and love it, but my Moto Zine is still my favorite as I give it 5 stars!

And they tell me that I do not sound like I am on a cellphone, they hear me loud and clear!8) The messaging is great, you can send text, pictures, videos or audio messages.9) Great MP3 player, easy to set up play lists and the sound is superb!10) Camera takes great pictures, great to use when I forget to bring my regular camera!11) File Manager - You can find files, rename files, delete files from your SD card on this phone. And it holds a micro SD card up to 4 gigs, although I placed a 8 gig in it and it worked.12) Battery life - can go 2 days using Wifi, camera, phone etc on a charge. And on standby several days!

So please get out your device and tape to compare what sizes I list will fit into this (I measured all of my devices I tested with the TPU cover on each device and I left the cover on it):PROS:+ Devices and sizes that will fit into this unit easily and I personally tested ALL I list and measured the sizes of all I tested from height, width and thickness (the thickness is the most important thing).Fits:+ Samsung Galaxy Player with 5 inch screen with a thick TPU Cover on - this measured 5 3/4 inch long x 1/2 inch deep (including the TPU Cover) x 3 1/2 wide. ***This is a heavy device as well as thick! All I had to do was place it gently, yet deeply and slowly down into the bottom of the groove on the Roadster. Do not FORCE a device into the Roadster, gently guide it in and make sure it locks into the bottom part so the device is secure.+ Samsung Galaxy S4 with Silicone Cover on it. Fits like a glove with the cover on!+ Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket with thick TPU cover, fits wonderfullyNote that most phones, GPS, etc will fit fine even with a Otter-box on them IF the thickness is not more than say 1/2 inch with the Otter-box or TPU cover on it.+ Ease of placing and removing from the dash - The bottom has a VERY STICKY mounting section and it sticks perfectly to the dash but be sure you clean the dash and have no dust, dirt or wax on the dash first or this will not hold as well.+ How to make like new again - the suction/sticky part can be cleaned by using household glass cleaner (Windex) or I find that a mild soap applied to a washcloth works well and then wipe clean to make sure soap residue is gone and the back is sticky again.So be sure and keep the back label in a handy drawer to refer to this.+ Special ways I use this mount (I  bought 2 of these) - 1) My car: it stays on the dash securely as I installed it with the sticky part and it really holds my devices perfectly!  2) My home (second unit) So I leave the second one on my bedside table and place my Samsung 5 inch Galaxy Player in it (Landscape) so it holds up my player and I can play my playlists during the night (so far I have not removed the covering for the sticky bottom as I do not want to damage my nice wooden table.+ Fit of all the devices I tried - All fit straight up in landscape mode. When I inserted each device in to test the fit, I noticed that each device fit into this TIGHTLY as there are soft rubber grippers that secure the device very tightly into the unit. Because of this, you CANNOT adjust the phone, GPS, player etc forward or backward (up or down) for a different eye level of viewing. In a sense, once you install your phone, GPS, player etc, it is in there tightly and locked in stone so to speak.One CON:- In the summertime, do NOT park your car in a hot area for a long period of time, say over 30 minutes because this unit is made of a rubber type of material and will melt.**If you have to park in a hot area for say over 30 minutes, then you should move this under your seat or if you can place a windshield sunglass SHADE on the windshield.If anyone reading this has any questions, please ask me.This is a wonderful product and the price is very reasonable. Highly recommend it to you.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Roadster Smartphone Sticky Pad Dash Mount is superb! A VERY DETAILED REVIEW!","unixReviewTime":1389830400,"reviewTime":"2014-01-16T00:00:00"}

When I first placed it on my phone, it took a little time to get it on the phone. Then it fit very snugly. This is normal for a \"Hard Gel\" type of phone cover. It is harder than silicone so it does not stretch like a silicone cover, yet is is thicker and fits so much better than a silicone cover or hard cover.

(Cannot do this anymore after OS 3.0 and higher).- Great camera - I took many high quality pictures and many were better than my regular camera.- Music Player (stock) is very good.

This review is for the WHITE INTERNATIONAL UNLOCKED version of this device. I bought it from Amazon but chose to do the review under the dark blue device because it has more reviews and will be read more often.***Over 30 days have past since I purchased the device (Feb 16, 2012), so I am more confident about this device as it works wonderfully in all areas! The reason I mention that is ALL INTERNATIONAL phones DO NOT have a US warranty and I took a HUGE chance spending $700 (at the time of purchase, it is now about $620) for this device! However, I have owed smartphones and computers for many years and have found that if they fail, 95% of the time they fail WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS! In fact all of my smartphones have \"shown\" me in the first 30 days by \"acting up\" whether they would last or not. I have NEVER (so far) had any problems with this device. It is superb. Below are PROS and CONS.PROS:1) Huge 5.3\" screen that is super vivid, clear and easy to read (and the phone is NOT TOO BIG, instead it is light and comfortable to hold.2) Great music player with good sound with the Samsung headset (included) or on speaker.3) FM radio included (AT&T; version does not have FM radio).4) Fast processor.5) I get 3G+ speeds for data and it is fast, fast, fast! (Mostly I use WiFi, but sometimes data and again, it is very fast). I have AT&T; data that I buy each month as I have the go-phone (pre-paid plan) and I buy the smallest data they have as I use WiFi 95% of the time.6) WiFi easy to connect and works perfectly with long range ability!7) Good stock browser, however, I downloaded Dolphin HD Browser and I can get \"desktop\" pages (not mobile pages) and also tabs, and so so many features. Opera is OK, but Dolphin HD blows all the other browsers away!8) Android 2.3.6 is fine for me, they say ICS comes out in late April or May for the GNote.9) Battery life - Decent - Since I am on WiFi or Data 100% of the time when I use this device so the battery lasts me about 5 hours before I have to recharge. Now when I turn the WiFi on and off to conserve battery, I get about 10 hours or more! Also I have backlight on 90%!10) I chose White color, very regal looking - so this is a pro for me!11) Size: Perfect combo mini tablet with 5.3\" screen and great phone, don't need to lug around my 10\" tablet anymore! And I do not think this device is too big to use as a phone and have no problem putting it up to me ear to make a call. This phone is lightweight and easy to hold. I now use a TPU clear cover for just $7 on eBay(shows off the device and does not show dirt) and also use a great cover that is for 5\" GPS I bought from Amazon for just $15 that is open at the top and does not have magnets in it. Samsung has said not to use this device anywhere near magnets (page 180 of the online PDF GNote manual).12) Camera and Video Camera - This takes better pictures than my regular camera and I move the pictures to my 32 gid SD card. And video is wonderful for a quick video! Mostly I take pictures when I am out and about, so no need to have to take my old camera as this device is: CAMERA, MINI TABLET, MUSIC PLAYER, FM RADIO ALL IN ONE DEVICE!!!!!CONS:1) NO US WARRANTY (but there is a UK (International warranty) 24 month warranty in the box). This phone came with a warranty was from the UK and I was given a UK phone number and address for the phone. In a sense, I do truly have a warranty for 24 months for this phone. However, I called Samsung at one of the US service locations and had a very long conversation with the rep. He explained that the reason that Samsung US Warranty does not cover this phone is because this is an international phone, not a phone made for the US and they warranted phones that are made for carriers in the US like AT&T; phones, Tmobile, Verizon, etc, not UNLOCKED INTERNATIONAL PHONES. However, he did say that I have a International Warranty with UK as stated on my 24 month warranty info that came with the phone. If it fails, I will have to call Samsung in the UK I believe and let them know that I am sending the phone, track it via USPS or whatever. However, I have a great feeling about the phone that this will not happen as the phone works superbly and I am very happy with it...I called Square Trade and they told me NO WARRANTY on non US (International) phones. They said they would \"assist\" in shipping or something like that, then I talked to a 2nd person and I was informed they did not warranty the Gnote international version. ***But I am not too worried, as my GNote works great and I am happy with my choice as I did not want AT&T; LOCKED VERSION. *Please not that 95% of the time, if a device is going to fail or malfunction, it is usually within the first 30 days. And I have used this device for well over 30 days and it is fast and has been perfect!TRUE STARS 4.5 STARS BECAUSE OF THE NO US WARRANTY, however a 24 month UK warranty enclosed.2) APN SETTINGS must be manually inputted (all international phones require this). WiFi and text messaging works right out of the box, however, APN settings are needed for Data and MMS messaging.--UPDATE SEPT 10. 2012--It took two updates OTA to get ICS on my GNote, however, I updated to ICS 4.04 from the older 2.3 Gingerbread very early this morning. So far, I really like it. I was able to keep all my APPS, Bookmarks in Dolphin Browser, Contacts, etc. However, I did have to change back to my favorite shortcuts to APPS (and all my APPS work great) on each screen and make new folders, etc. I did have to make new playlists though. The only things I discovered that I really dislike about ICS is more memory use and the battery goes down faster. I now have about 350 free and before had 450 free. However, this is probably due to the much larger OS in 4.04 over 2.3! Also for me, the battery does not last as long. This is just from the first day, so hopefully things will improve. The fact that I have wanted ICS since Feb 2012 when I purchased the GNote, and finally decided to upgrade, I can live with this. Now I have heard that Jelly Bean 4.1 OTA update will be available for the GNote in late October. Looking very forward to updating to JB (hopefully in an OTA in late October, 2012) Also looking forward to the GNote II coming out probably in November or December with Jelly Bean in the US!Please leave comments and I will answer all. Also, if anyone needs AT&T; or T-Mobile APN settings, please ask in the comments and I will post them...","overall":5.0,"summary":"SUPERB PHONE/TABLET - PLEASE READ IMPORTANT INFO BELOW...","unixReviewTime":1332201600,"reviewTime":"2012-03-20T00:00:00"}

However, in my experience, most devices \"act up\" or \"fail\" within the first 30 days, (about 90% of the time), I am not worried, as I have had the phone well over 30 days and it is working perfectly and I am very pleased with my purchase of this device.

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B0075WLO60","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[17,23],"reviewText":"This superb phone with many features and being a techie, I have fully tested this phone. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Skyrocket S2 phone. Although I paid more to purchase this phone NEW, I am very glad that I did so as it is working wonderfully! My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me (with a 4.5\" viewing screen like the S3 has). For me, I keep this phone inside a case and cover and it still fits easily into a rather small purse. And also I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music when I work out. Since the phone is lightweight, it is easy to wear on my waistband (in the storage case).- Unlocked Sim - Yes, the phone I received is NEW and I tested the Sim slot to make sure it was unlocked. First I inserted my neighbors T-Mobile standard Sim card (she has a pre-paid plan with no data plan). I simply popped it into the phone and it worked right out of the box, called someone and it worked great. Sent a text (with no pictures or attachments, just text and went fine). Then I removed her Sim and placed my own AT&T; Activated Sim card (Standard sized card). With the T-Mobile and AT&T; Sim cards, this phone worked perfectly as the phone is SIM UNLOCKED, the basic AT&T; Logo is still there, the original AT&T; Apps still there. But you can use say T-Mobile, Straight Talk, or MOST GSM Sim cards should work just fine--just make sure you buy the UNLOCKED ONE not the locked to AT&T; one.However, if you want to use anything other than AT&T;, please contact me in comments for the APN settings for Data and MMS as I have all the settings.One more thing if it says UNLOCKED rather than International Unlocked, it means that JUST THE SIM CARD SLOT is Unlocked for most GSM Standard Sized Sim Cards but still shows the AT&T; Logo on the top front of the phone. Since I did not do anything on my neighbors Sim card but make a quick call and try it for about 30 minutes (she is thinking about buying this phone for herself and using T-Mobile as she does not an AT&T; Account). Also, if you use WiFi like I do, no need for data unless you are in an out of WiFi area a lot of the time. For me, I am around WiFi 95 to 99 percent of the time!- LARGE SCREEN WITH GOOD RESOLUTION - This absolutely gorgeous screen measures 4.5 inches (seems larger) and it is just the right sized screen. Before this phone I used to use a Galaxy Note and Grand (both had 5 inch or more screens), both were too big, heavy and bulky. Now, I am using the S2 Skyrocket as the screen is large and has good resolution with 207 ppi (pixels per inch) and higher is better. This has a very sharp screen with easy to read screen. It looks to me as sharp as my old Galaxy Note I did and MUCH MUCH sharper than my Galaxy Grand (which just had 187 ppi and it was not as clear as the S2 Skyrocket) so that extra 20 pixels per inch makes a big difference in my opinion. Again, this screen is so vivid and clear!- STANDARD REGULAR SIZE SIM CARD: This phone has a regular/standard Sim card slot. (Note the S3 regular phone and S4 phones accept a micro Sim. So glad that this phone accepts a regular/standard Sim.-- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the ONE OF THE BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 16GB of Internal space. The 16GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 10.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- CAMERA - The 8MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a very good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.- OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. For me, I use an OTG Micro Adapter (S3 and S4 ones work) and am able to plug in a flash drive, mouse and more. Could not get my portable Hard Disk to work, but flash drives work fine.- NFC (Near Field Communication) has been advertised to work on this phone. Have not yet tried this feature.CONS:- No built in FM Radio like the regular SII has. Not a problem because I installed TuneIn Radio (free) from the Playstore and I can play lots of radio (FM or other) when WiFi is on.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.

Below I give my findings on this battery and some suggestions on charging and more for the S3 Mini:1) First I made sure that I used a 2AMP Genuine Samsung Charger base with a heavy duty USB cable attached. The reason that I do this is that I noticed that the S3 Mini, and other Samsung devices charge much faster with a genuine Samsung Charger base with either or 1 AMP or a 2 AMP (the 2 AMP is MUCH FASTER to charge the phone).And the high quality USB is best, I used a high speed USB cable).2) So I installed the new battery into the phone and the battery showed 53%, which is about right. Some may come in as low as 20% if they were on the shelf a while.3) Then I plugged in the charger and USB into the phone and timed it to see exactly how long it would take to charge this battery--note that the phone is ON while it is charging:- In exactly ONE HOUR, the battery was already up to 84% - so in just one hour using this process, it had already charged 31%, this is very good!- In ONE HOUR and TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES I checked once again and it was at 100% charged.This in my opinion, is very fast charging times and this battery is very responsive.Also, after that, I ran a test of the battery to see how long it took to do down and it did actually somewhat better than my original Samsung battery (but I have some problems with the Samsung one from the start).What I did to check the battery: 1) I used WiFi about 50% of the time for one hour to see how much battery is used in one hour. And I went on Boat Browser Mini and several websites, checked email that kind of thing. 2) At the end of one hour this is what my battery percent showed: 87% left! On my old Samsung battery, I would have had just 80% left after one hour so this is a nice improvement!Highly recommend this battery! In fact, I plan on buying more of these batteries for my other phone.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Superb Battery and Charged Fast!

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B00861O8EO","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[103,110],"reviewText":"September 8, 2013 (UPDATED REVIEW).First let me say that I own TWO of these tablets. One I let me sister-in-law use and one I use. Both are EXCEPTIONAL Tablets. The newest one that I received in August, 2013 came with Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 and I am using that one now and very pleased with it. However, my first P3100 I have had almost a year now and it still has Ice Cream Sandwich. But I heard that 4.2.2 may be coming to this tablet soon (November 2013) so this is good news!- Archived Flash: I have installed Archived Adobe Flash and now can play flash videos including Amazon videos. If you need instructions, ask me in the comments.The fact that it has a built in phone and is 3g and 3g+ capable, I love this device and use it as BOTH A PHONE AND A TABLET. The size is PERFECT and easy to carry around in my bag or purse.This are my pros and cons on this DATA/PHONE TABLET Tab 2 7.0:Pros:1) Data capable (this works perfectly on my AT&T; and I get 3g and find the speed is very fast! Gets extra star for this.2) Phone capable (note that this device nor the P3113 Student one comes with a phone headset and does not come with headphones). I already had headphones for my Galaxy Note, so I use these for making phone calls with this device with no problems and the connection is strong, loud and very clear! Gets extra star for this.3) Easy to set up with STANDARD (regular full sized) SIM card. This device is unlocked and will work for 3g on AT&T; and 2g on T-Mobile and other GSMs. And I did not have to enter the ATM settings, it did this automatically when I started the setup, opened the data and I logged on to my Gmail, etc and then turned off data and then on to WiFi settings, etc. See next section for how to set up WiFi.4) WiFi setup (EASY): Here is how I set it up: I went into Settings, WiFi and turned the WiFi on. When it turned on, it showed my home WiFi router modem. I then selected this to connect and it asked me for the passcode (the router had it on it ). Then I typed in the passcode and my WiFi started right up with a excellent connection!5) Came with ICS 4.03 but so far there is no update to 4.04, but I am hoping in time there will be as Jellybean is coming out OTA in November. The ICS 4.03 runs very fast (more on this below).6) I use the KEYBOARD DOCK that came with my P3113 and USB adapter to transfer files from USB drive to device. The same accessories that came with P3113 (WiFi only) work great on this tablet as well...CONS:1) NO US Warranty for this International Version. However, since most devices fail within the first 30 days, I have found, so you can bring it back to the store as defective.2) No Adobe Flash installed (this is NOT the fault of Samsung, it is an Android problem). However, I found a workaround and installed Archived Adobe Flash and watch online videos all the time. Ask if you need more info on Archived Flash.Bottom line: Would I purchase this device all over again? Yes, in a heartbeat as I purchased it for the phone and data capabilities and have been very happy with this device. However, if you DO NOT NOT need data or phone in a tablet and have your favorite cellphone/smartphone you use then get the P3113 WiFi only version and save yourself $100 and also you will have a warranty.Thank you for reading this review and I hope that it has been helpful for you. Also, if you have questions or comments, please ask as I am a techie person.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Great Data/WiFi/Phone Tablet Detailed Review Below...","unixReviewTime":1350518400,"reviewTime":"2012-10-18T00:00:00"}

However, for me, I found many great features of this set:1) It is a genuine Samsung replacement. This set is just like my original Samsung Stereo headset that came with my Samsung phone.2) The sound is of GOOD QUALITY (and good enough for listening to music when out and about) and GREAT for making phone calls. I find that when I make a phone call using this set, I can hear the person clearly and they can hear me clearly.3) Works on EVERY phone, tablet or device that uses a 3.5 headjack. It does not have to be a Samsung device.4) Price - Very affordable. With the price being low and the sound quality good (but not superb), these make a great value and are worthy of a purchase of not just one set.

It will fit thicker phones even with a silicone cover on the phone (phones that are thicker in depth like S3 Mini with TPU Cover or Silicone Cover, S2 with TPU Cover or Silicone Cover, Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos with TPU or Silicone cover.+ Two back adjustments to adjust the phone's portrait or landscape levels of viewing.+ Open bottom so you can charge some phones while using it (some phones). For me, I place my phone in landscape and it charges in the stand.***Security on my desk - To make this stand more secure on my desk: I put a sticky mat (small) on my desk and placed this stand on top of it.

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B008TUQ7SC","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Well I was very surprised when I received this very high quality stand for many reasons. What I like best is it will hold portrait and landscape many different size and types of devices. Most all of these were tested in this stand with their TPU thick covers on the device. And I tested this with several phones and also I tested this on several sixes of tablets:  a 7 inch tablet, 8 inch tablet and 10 inch.Below I list in the PROS my actual test findings and more info on this stand as to the features of it:PROS:+ Phones and MP3 players (large and small) I tested and  how this stand performed - First I tested my large Samsung Galaxy 5 MP3 Player with the TPU Cover on. Even at 1/2 inch thickness, this stand held my player in portrait and landscape SECURELY!Samsung Galaxy S4 with a thick silicone cover on it - fits fine. Samsung Galaxy Grand with TPU cover fits fine in portrait and landscape.+ Tablets - So I tested 3 Samsung Galaxy tablets: 1) Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with TPU cover (thickness of 1/2 inch). This fit perfectly both landscape and portrait. Note that this particular tablet is very heavy (compared to Tab 3 line or iPads), and it fit very securely. 2) Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 with TPU cover (not as heavy or thick as the Tab 2 7.0), this tablet fit beautifully in the stand for portrait or landscape. 3) Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 (this is a very heavy and thick tablet). I do not have a TPU cover for this, so I placed it into the stand with no cover and it fit perfectly in portrait and in landscape. **If it can fit this bulky and heavy tablet, it can fit most any device with ease!+ Adjustments - There are FOUR total adjustments on this stand once you open it from the folded mode.1) Upright (tall) mode (for leaning the device more upright) - this is the top adjustment on the back of the stand -- be sure that you press this in the top groove to LOCK the stand's back for security.2) More flat mode (Lounge-chair mode for leaning the device at more of an angle backwards- This is when you want more of a backward angle when say you are watching a video, movie, this kind of thing. Be sure to lock in this on the bottom groove in the stand to make sure it is secure and stays in place.3) Device stand  standard mode - This is where you stand your phone or tablet. So in the regular mode you can really fit a thicker device in this stand and sometimes I use this. But when I have a thinner device such as a thin phone, I go to locking stand mode (below).4) Locking stand mode - I advise this one for phones! To secure this mode for your phone do this: Pull down the bottom part of the stand (the part where you place your phone) until you hear it make a snapping sound. Then place your phone into the stand. You will see right away if you look on the side view that this seems to hug the table better on the bottom and it grabs onto the phone better making it more secure. *Suggestion: Use this if you have a thinner phone. For me, I use this stand for my Galaxy Player 5 which is thick at 1/2 inch deep and so I use the standard mode on that.** Front standing modes: May I suggest that you try each one of the front device stand modes and see which one you prefer and which one works better on your phone.+ Charging my devices in this stand  (and using them at the same time) - For me I can easily charge my phones in portrait mode while in this stand (the Samsung phones and Samsung MP3 player). The 7 and 8 inch tablets I can also charge and use at the same time in this stand if they are in landscape mode. Yes, I was also able to charge my Tab 2 10.1 (in portrait mode) wonderfully and even got it to charge in landscape (turning it upside down).  Although this is not a docking station, I use it almost like it is because of the charging ability (it has a large open part at the bottom in which to insert your charging cable into the stand/device).+ Overall quality, design and portability- The quality I found very good. The design I love because of all the adjustments and best of all all the many types and sizes this stand will accommodate!The fact that it folds makes this stand easy to fold and go and use at work, at home, anywhere! Yet for me, I have one on my bedside table and one I keep in my purse for when I am on the go!Highly recommend this stand!","overall":5.0,"summary":"This iKross Portable Folding Mobile Phone Stand works wonderfully holding my Tablets, Phone even with TPU Covers on-READON...","unixReviewTime":1390003200,"reviewTime":"2014-01-18T00:00:00"}

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B009PLBLQC","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[511,524],"reviewText":"Great phone, one of the best, if not the best I ever used! In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3\" screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Mini S3 phone. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Update 8/24/13 - Just received today, the newest firmware/OS for the 4.1.2 OTA (on my phone directly) as it was updated from Samsung and this is very new at this date of Monday, August 5, 2013 and arrived in my phone's Notification area today. After the upgrade completed, I noticed at once that this phone is lightning fast and the touchscreen is very, very fast and responsive! This is the THIRD update that I received since I purchased this phone in April 2013. Each update is not that large, however, it enhances the performance of this phone. Very encouraged as if the updates keep coming regularly, perhaps4.2.2 will be coming to the S3 Mini. And from my research, it is possible that the S3 Mini may receive the 4.2 OS but it will be a while longer...Till then, I shall keep on trying to update and keep you informed...PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD: The S3 Mini has a standard Sim card slot (unlike the full sized S3 that has a micro Sim slot). Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the S3 Mini and I was good to go, and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery.  What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy Note with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Galaxy S3 Mini - Just Right Size With Many Features - Detailed Review","unixReviewTime":1368144000,"reviewTime":"2013-05-10T00:00:00"}

This dual charger is has truly amazed me as I will show below.PROSDual Ports - The first port which is the top one has more amp power - this is the one that I charged my Tab 2 10.1 tablet in and also tried my Tab 3 8.0 - each charged perfectly and FAST! (Note that I use on the top port the Mediabridge Hi-Speed USB 2.0 - (6 Feet) - A-Male to Micro-B Cable which I used this cable for better results and faster chargingB004GF8TIKSo I use the six foot one because I can charge and use my tablet from a long distance away while it is charging.The second port is where I charged my Samsung Grand phone in (which has one amp). Used a regular Samsung USB cable for this port.Charging Time: On both devices (and using good USB cable), I found that from 30 percent to 100 percent both were charged in two and one half hours, which for charging both at the same time is exceptional. On my Samsung chargers it took me about three and one half hours to charge so I saved ONE HOUR and charged two devices.Travel Function - Because the plug prongs fold down flat, I place them in my travel bag with my two cables and am ready for travel. For me, I put all of this into a double zip lock bag in my purse so I have my dual charger set with me.Price - Think about it, this is TWO chargers for the price of one and a very high quality charger at that!CONS - None!Overall Value to me - Before I purchased this dual charger, I could not get my Samsung tablets or phones to fully charge or charge properly on non-Samsung chargers.

Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction \"manual\" provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the model with the N on the model number. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the BIG S3, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it.

The other for overall uses such as using for general purposes as using to type on the screen keyboard, surfing the web, keeping the screen clean.

Since I already had a charger base for a USB cable, I just inserted the cable into the base and the unit fully charged up in about 2 hours.**This is my very first Bluetooth Speaker set and I am so very impressed on so many levels! The sound of these speakers is just amazing for many genres of music I play, my podcasts and my audio books, the sound has such richness and depth.+ Pairing - This speaker is very easy to pair with my Tablets and phones and even my MP3 players! So I first paired up all the units so I can use these speakers with any device I choose to.+ Excellent Sound Quality - The treble is excellent and the bass is very good. Though this is a small sized Bluetooth speaker set, I am amazed at the overall richness in sound. The sound will go quite loud if needed and I learned quickly how to adjust the sound on these speakers: To turn down the sound do a long hard press on the back button (the sound shares the button with the back and forward buttons). To increase the sound, do a long hard press of the forward button.**Note that to turn up or down the volume say on your phone or tablet's player, you can also press the volume up in the player to increase the sound. However, I did this first AND then pressed the volume up in the Bluetooth Speaker.+ Other Uses For This Bluetooth Speaker Set:1) Plug in a flash drive and play MP3 songs from there. What is does is make the Flash drive like a portable MP3 Player. So I have a favorite extra song Flash Drive (16gb) that I tried out and played all of my music played great. So I have several Flash Drives dedicated to music and podcasts so now, I can use these speakers to play my on the go music from my flash drives!These songs were not in folders, just in a long playlist as each flash drive has a long playlist on it.2) Plug in a SD Card adapter with a micro SD card inserted or you can plug in a standard sized SD card with your favorite MP3 songs on it. So I found a couple of SD cards (1GB and 2GB and copied my favorite music with instrumental and the other favorite songs). So I tried each of these in my EasyAcc CSR Bluetooth Speaker and the sound is superb!3) Portable entertainment center - So I use this with my phone and tablets of course, however, since I have 2 SD cards and 2 flash drives filled with music, I can use this as a stand alone portable stereo.For me, I bring this speaker all around my home: Kitchen, back porch, bedroom on nightstand for easy listening to fall asleep (I use my soft instrumental music with the SD card plugged into this speaker and and plays all night long. In the morning I recharge.This unit is perfect for taking on trips, like in a hotel room, park, beach or wherever you want to enjoy music wirelessly!If you like to travel and love to listen to music on the go (Bluetooth with your device or using your SD card, Flash Drive, look no more, I believe that you will love this EasyAcc Bluetooth Speaker unit!Note: I was supplied the Easy CSR Bluetooth Speakers for testing and evaluation, and agreed to review the item, therefore this is a fair and honest review as I truly am amazed by this product!","overall":5.0,"summary":"Bluetooth Speaker With Excellent Sound Quality!

And if you are searching for an excellent dual charger, let me suggest this one to you as I think that you will benefit from it for the following reasons:1) Charging time - This I placed my Tablet USB cable into the top port and my phone's USB cable into the bottom port and charged them four and a half hours for testing purposes and I charged both devices at the same time. The tablet was down to 62% and the phone was down to 60%. Both showed 100 percent when I unplugged them from the charger four and a half hours later. (I set a timer for this so I would not forget to check).***It is very possible that they were charged to 100 percent before this time, however, I usually charge my devices at night anyway with a charging time of about eight hours.2) Plug fits into the bottom socket and leaves room for my top socket to add yet another charger, thus I can really have 3 devices charging with one outlet. What I did was this: I plugged in the iClever dual charger in the bottom socket and on the top socket, I placed a HTC charger (it is not wide). Also this worked with I plugged in a Motorola Micro Charger in the top socket. ***If you have a wide type of charger that you want to use on the top socket, it may not fit, so try a charger that is not so wide and it will work fine in the top socket.3) The prongs fold down for traveling in this charger. This prevents the plug from snagging on items in your bag.4) Well constructed and compact - This charger you can place easily in a zip-lock bag with your USB cables and you are ready to hit the road.This unit was sent to me for testing and for giving an unbiased and honest review.

Simply would not begin the charge! When I unplugged that cable and inserted the Samsung cable or tried a higher end cable, the charge began.

Since the instructions are not that detailed, I included my personal instructions on how to use this with my review (it took me 2 hours to take notes and then write my own, so hopefully this will help you save time and get this going faster).+ The other Pro is that the sound is OK, could be louder.

The volume on the MP3 feature is very loud and clear however.- Has a mini USB charger port instead of the popular macro port that most devices use these days. (But they include the mini USB cable for this).Therefore, my true rating is 4.6 stars as I took off some because of the fact that I have to remove my SD card when I want to use the audio cord and the fact that on Bluetooth and Audio modes, the sound is not as loud as when on the MP3 model.Recommend this because: For the low cost of this speaker, it has many features and it is portable and it has in and out cord, and accepts a micro SD card so you can use this as a music player!","overall":5.0,"summary":"Nice and portable Mini Bluetooth Speaker with many features &#8211; A VERY detailed review.","unixReviewTime":1389744000,"reviewTime":"2014-01-15T00:00:00"}

After testing this headset I discovered that it has some very nice advantages over other Bluetooth headsets:1) SOUND QUALITY - This headset has a full range of sound on it as it tested it on many genres: Pop, Classical, Rock and more. And I also listened to a couple of audiobooks and found the narrators voice to be very clear.2) AUDIO CABLE -  Until this headset, I have not ever seen a Bluetooth headset with an included audio cable (to use with non Bluetooth devices). There is a 3.5mm audio male to male cable included in the box. So I plugged this into my computer and listened to a Playlist. The sound is excellent, so much better than my old headset.In addition, I tried cable connected to the headset on my older portable CD player and the sound is excellent as well.3) Outside buttons - Dedicated On/Off/Connect button to turn Bluetooth On and connect.***To turn the Bluetooth ON and get ready to pair do this: Press down the On/Off Button for about 9 seconds: You will hear a sound and see both RED and BLUE lights blinking at the same time FAST. You are now ready to connect to your phone the Bluetooth Headset - the name on this headset you will see is named LB918.HINT: Always turn on the Bluetooth Headset BEFORE you turn on the Bluetooth on your phone or tablet. Then press scan for devices.4) Comfortable - This headset DOES NOT slip off my head when I am working out at the Gym or speedwalking etc. And it is comfortable on my head-it has adjustments on each side and fits my head perfectly.In addition, there is leather covering the ear cups and they grasp my ear well.5) Folds up for easy portability. When I go to the Gym, I fold this headset up and place it into my gym bag (to keep it clean etc, I put it into a zip-lock bag).6) USB Charging Cable is MICRO not mini, which is the standard now. When I am finished listening to the headset, I just plug in the USB cable into my computer's USB port and let it charge.7)  Phone use - This worked just fine with my phone and I was able to hear well and the other person could hear me loud and clear.Highly  recommend this headset to anyone - especially if you work out or very active![Provided to me by Aleratec for testing and for my honest review].

First I turned on the Bluetooth on this to begin the Bluetooth on the speaker. Then I tapped the On button for 2 seconds to place it into pairing mode. Then I turned on my device and it paired and connected in seconds!In fact, I paired/connected this so very easily with my tablets and my phone!2) Loudness and Loudness Control - There is NO UP or Down loudness regulator on the speaker, so it is best to have the tablet or the phone as close to the speaker as possible to regulate the sound.It would have been nice to have an up and down loudness control on the speaker, however, since I keep my phone or tablet closeby so I regulate the sound from the tablet or phone.Loudness - For listening to most songs, FM Radio and movies, etc, I found the sound is just fine as this is a personal speaker and the sound is very clear.3) In/Out Cable - So I was able to connect this to other devices without having to use Bluetooth part.Also, I connected it to my phone's FM Radio for a very clear sound on all stations. Love this feature.4) Sound Quality - Excellent sound quality considering that it is a very small speaker.5) Phone Answering/Speaker - So I tried this feature out on this device. First, I paired/connected this to my Android phone. Then I had a friend call me and the phone rang plenty loud enough through this Bluetooth speaker. Then I spoke to the person and they spoke to me. Both of us could hear one another OK with no distortion.6) Nightlight Ability - This Bluetooth speaker sits on my bedside table at night next to smartphone and listen to my playlist while drifting off to sleep. The soft blue light on this Bluetooth speaker allows me to see my smartphone and also I can see well if I need to get up during the night! What a great feature!7) Size and Portability - Small and so travel-able! And so well made! Really nice Bluetooth Speaker!8) Other Purposes for the Speaker and Contents - This unit arrived with a USB charger (plugs into my laptop to re-charge). This arrived with a a USB Cable so you can plug it into your laptop or computer to charge. It also comes with an in and out line so I was able to connect to non Bluetooth device and still listen to the speaker.9) Charger Info Tip for you - Helpful tip for you: If you own an extra USB Wall charger (base) that connects a USB cable on it for charging, and prefer it charged in a wall socket, then you can plug in the USB cable that came with this device in the device and the USB wall charger. This is what I did: I found an old HTC 1AMP USB Charger (the part with the wall prongs). Then I just plugged the USB cable that came with this unit into it and keep it charged at night in the wall.

So you will need to use your own USB cable or purchase a new one for your device. Below are the reasons why I really am very pleased and will continue to use this charger:PROS+ Dual Ports - The first port which is the top one has more amp power because it is a 2 AMP source - this is the one that I charged my Tab 2 10.1 tablet in and also tried my Galaxy phone - each charged perfectly and FAST! (Note that I use on the top port the Mediabridge Hi-Speed USB 2.0 - (6 Feet) - A-Male to Micro-B Cable which I used this cable for better results and faster charging.+ Charging Time: On both devices (and using good USB cable), I found that from 30 percent to 100 percent both were charged in two and one half hours, which for charging both at the same time is exceptional. On my Samsung chargers it took me about three and one half hours to charge so I saved ONE HOUR and charged two devices.+ Works with so many devices - You just add your own USB cable for your device be it a phone or tablet, or music player and begin charging. The light is blue to show you it is charging. (It works with so many brands as iPhone, iPad, Kindle, Samsung Galaxy line, and many more!+ Small Footprint - So I placed this charger into the bottom outlet and still had room to plug in yet another single micro charger for my MP3 Player and all three devices charged at the same time!+ Travel Function - Because the plug prongs fold down flat, I place them in my travel bag with my two cables and am ready for travel. For me, I put all of this into a double zip lock bag in my purse so I have my dual charger set with me.+ Price - Think about it, this is TWO chargers for the price of one and a very high quality charger at that!+ Overall Use And Value - This charger works almost as fast as my original Samsung 2amp and 1amp chargers! And the fact that I usually charge overnight anyway so I did not notice any difference when I charged overnight. When on the go, I usually charge my tablet or phone in the car with a car charger so this dual charger is perfect for my home or when I travel to a hotel, etc.One last note: This unit was provided to me for testing, evaluation and for reviewing.

Since I already had a charger base for a USB cable, I just inserted the cable into the base and the unit fully charged up in about 2 hours. This is the EASIEST to use Bluetooth speaker that I own and love that how easy it is to turn on and set etc...PROS:+ Pairing - This speaker is very easy to pair with my Tablets and phones and even my MP3 players! So I first paired up all the units so I can use these speakers with any device I choose to.+ Excellent Sound Quality - The treble is excellent and the bass is very good. Because this  Bluetooth speaker set has nice separation between the small speakers, I am amazed at the overall richness in sound (I compared the sound to my very small round Bluetooth speakers and the sound on this is superior to the small speakers). And the sound will go quite loud if needed and I learned quickly how to adjust the sound on these speakers: To turn down the sound do a long hard press on the back button (the sound shares the button with the back and forward buttons). To increase the sound, do a long hard press of the forward button).+ Playing Time - So I let this Bluetooth Speaker run and it played for eight hours and ten minutes before it needed a re-charge. Very pleased with this!+ Bluetooth distance (superb) - So I paired this with my phone and left my phone at one end of my home and then started walking with this Speaker to see how many feet it would play. And it played perfectly until I reached 57.5 feet away (I found this better than the specs said)! To test it even more I moved this outside in my backyard and it still played well.+ Audio In and Out Port (with supplied audio cable). This I use to play my old CD portable player and also use to play my built in FM radio in my phone (it requires a wired headset or in and out with speaker to play my phone's radio). This is so easy, just turn the unit on and plug in the cable to the phone or CD Player and it will play via this speaker in regular speaker mode and it has such a rich sounding bass and treble.+ Volume UP or DOWN on the unit - When you press the + on the speaker, it will increase the sound loudness level. The trick it to HOLD DOWN this not tap it and then the loudness will increase. To lower the sound, do the same thing but on the - Button.  Of course you can use your phone or MP3 player to increase the sound but the outside of the speaker increases the sound and it will get VERY LOUD! I use this in my kitchen and dining area (which is a very large area) and it truly fills these rooms. While I am cooking and washing dishes, and even dining, the sound fills this area nicely!This unit is perfect for taking on trips, like in a hotel room, park, beach or wherever you want to enjoy music wirelessly!One minor Con:- FM RADIO PART - Must mention that  I could not get the FM Radio part to work, but since I have so many FM radios around my home, this is not a problem for me.Note: I was supplied this Easy CSR Bluetooth Speaker for testing and evaluation, and agreed to review the item, therefore this my unbiased review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Bluetooth Speaker With Excellent Sound Quality!

It has many advantages that I list below.PROS:1) Pairing/Connecting - Once I pressed the correct function from the multi-purpose Power Button, it did pair with my tablet and my Android phone just fine.*Helpful hint: Be sure to turn on your Android device's Bluetooth FIRST before you attempt to pair/connect it with this Bluetooth Speaker. Then turn on the Bluetooth speaker and let your phone or tablet search for devices. This makes it so much easier to pair/connect. Once it is paired for the first time, the next time connecting is so easy!2) Sound Quality / LoudnessLOUDNESS - For a smaller speaker, in the shower even with the water on full force, the sound is VERY LOUD (can be turned down).*Helpful hint for you about loudness: First, if you plan on listening to songs from your Playlist from your phone on this, adjust the phone's sound FIRST to your liking and louder than you think because you will need it kind of loud in the shower. Also you can turn the volume UP OR DOWN on the Bluetooth speaker by using the top or bottom (on the left side)buttons.SOUND QUALITY on this speaker:The sound quality is very good to excellent for such a small unit. So I compared this to a larger Bluetooth Speaker that I own and use (that is not waterproof one like this one is) that I have and the sound was very, very close in sound quality and loudness. The overall Treble is quite good and for me, the Bass is pretty good as well. This is a huge plus for this Bluetooth speaker!3) FM Radio - Since I live on top of a hill and near a mountain and lots of trees, usually I cannot get FM that well in Bluetooth types of devices/radios. However, this one was able to CLEARLY pickup two of my favorite stations loud and clear and they stayed on while in the shower.CONS:1) The device's Power On has many multi-purposes on it. Personally, I would have preferred to see a dedicated BLUETOOTH ON/OFF button and also a POWER ON/OFF Button. As it is now this ONE BUTTON does all of these:--Turns on the device--Turns on Bluetooth.--Turns off Bluetooth--Turn on the FM Radio.--Serves as a charging indicator (when you turn it off and then plug in the USB cable, then the light changes to a NON BLINKING RED.

For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Built in slip proof cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I purchased on Amazon a slim cover and a genuine Moto back in a Pinkish Purple and this keeps the phone protected and anti slip etc.+ Screen Resolution - VERY CLEAR!

And for the newer updates and new apps that are Kit Kit approved/Kit Kat ready, I was able to move them over to the SD card to save space.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Very, very fast--in fact in the back of my home, I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. . Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected to the router, no loss in speed. **Note that I had other phones before this one and for me, none gave me the quick connect and overall speed as this one!+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+ LTE is amazing! For me, I use AT&T; and I have noticed that the LTE data is super fast loading webpages, opening emails on this phone --- it is so much faster than in my last phone with just t 3G on it, I can really tell the difference.+  Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest RocketPlayer (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Battery Life- Excellent and the best I have found yet! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc).  However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 15 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ OTG - The micro USB port on this phone is OTG (On the Go) compatible, this means that if you order a OTG Adapter Cable, then you can place a flash drive, USB Mouse and more into this phone. For me, I have been able to place my 32GB Flash drive in this adapter and easily copy files from this phone to my flash drive!+  Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging!+ 5MP Camera - For a 5MP, actually I found that my pictures came out clearer and better when I did this:-  I DO NOT USE the AUTO setting, just the flash or no flash and my pictures come out better now. My outdoor pictures I do not take in bright, bright sunlight, I take in shade and my pictures come out better. However, for more serious and highly detailed picture taking, I like to use my regular digital camera.+ File Manager - I went to the Playstore and found Astro File Manager, it is easy to find my files on my SD External card and also on the phone. Liked it so much, I bought the AD FREE version!**Notes regarding the camera: I found that if I leave my flash either on or off (and do not set to AUTO), the pictures have come out so much better now (clearer with better color etc). I took some outdoor shots and indoor shots after this and found that my pictures really looked nice!CONS:- New Adobe Flash is not supported; however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play).Bottom line: Would I buy this phone over again? Yes I certainly would buy this exceptional phone all over again. If you are looking for a easy to use and reasonably priced Android smartphone that has wonderful battery life, let me suggest this phone to you. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Motorola Moto G LTE - A Detailed Review Regarding the Many Excellent Features of This Phone.","unixReviewTime":1404172800,"reviewTime":"2014-07-01T00:00:00"}

So what I do is this: When the tablet gets down to about 75 percent, then I put it on the charger for a few minutes at least to make sure I have my battery going while I am on the go.Personally, I like using this more for my phone because I have to have my phone charged and always charged for phone calls, and other purposes. And this charger does charge my phone quickly. Yet, it is good to know that it also charges a tablet, just takes longer.At a rating of 1.5 amps, this is a perfect compliment for a smartphone's on the go charger, it is small and fits easily into your pocket or purse, of super high quality.

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B00HHEAMXC","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"When I bought this heavy duty stand I knew going in that is primarily made to hold the iPhone and iPad devices (without an Otterbox), yet I found that it will work on other brands such as Samsung and I will list below which Samsung phones that this stand will accommodate well (this will include several models of tablets and phones that fit into this stand).  In addition, below I list in the PROS my actual test findings and more info on this stand as to the features of it:PROS:+ Several Adjustments (to many eye levels) - This can be easily adjusted on so many levels so you can angle your phone to whatever viewing level you want to. This stand has the most adjustments for any stand that I have ever used.+ Charging my devices in this stand (and using them at the same time) - Since there is no open space on the bottom of this stand in which to insert a charger, I just place my phone or tablet in landscape and keep it in the stand and charge it this way. Then I can still use the stand (in landscape) while it is charging when it is in need of a charge).+ Sturdiness / Build Quality / Appearance - Because this stand is heavier than most other stands, and the fact that it is wider than most stands, plus the rubber grippers on the bottom of the stand, it will not slide around like most other stands do. Since the color is silver, it has that more professional and classy appearance when sitting on your desk at work or in a home office etc. This case has that classy designer look totally!+ Devices I tested that fit into this stand (including my Tab 2's and TAB 3 which all fit perfectly in portrait and landscape perfectly in this stand).(While iPhone and iPad (without case) fits well into this stand, for me, I own Samsung devices, so I tested them and give my test results):* Samsung Galaxy S4 YES even with a silicone cover on the phone - the phone fit almost all the way down to the bottom of this case (there is just very tiny gap that I noticed when looking sideways at the fit). However, because this stand has an inside all rubber gripper on it, my S4 fit into this securely even with the silicone cover. **It will not fit if you have the S4 in an Otterbox though. Good news! If you have a barely there case of the S4 or no case on it, it will go all the way down into the stand in portrait mode.It does go all the way down in the stand in landscape mode.* Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos - With a barely there back type of case (thin cover) on it fits most of the way down, but down enough in the slot to feel secure. If no case is on the Grand, it fits in portrait all the way down into the stand. In landscape with the thin case on it, it fits all the way down into the slot in this stand. It will not fit if you have an Otterbox on the Grand.* Samsung Galaxy S3 - Fits well with a slim barely there back case. Fits well without a case.* Samsung Galaxy S2 - In portrait mode: With a slim barely there cover, it went part of the way down into the slot and felt secure. With a TPU case or silicone case, it kind of went down, but not as secure as I liked. Without a case, however, it went all the way down into the slot. In landscape and in barely there cover, it did go most of the way down with the slim barely there back case.* Samsung Galaxy Player 4.2 with barely there back case. Fits perfectly and goes all the way down into the slot on this stand.* Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 - Without a case, this player fit most of the way down into the slot in Portrait mode. With a thin, barely there type of cover, no, it did not fit well in portrait mode, yet in landscape mode, it went all of the way down in the slot even with a cover on it.* Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (without a TPU cover). The tablet fit very well into this stand and went fully into the slot both in portrait and landscape positions. Since the Tab 3 7.0 and 10.1 are thin in depth, they should fit fine as well.* Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (both the 7 and 10) tested both (without any TPU cover) and each one fit perfectly into the slot in portrait and in landscape.* Samsung S3 MINI - I tried this both with a TPU cover and with no cover and there is NO WAY that I would recommend this phone with this stand because of the very rounded edges design of the S3 Mini. If you own this phone and need a stand, then I suggest this one: iKross Universal Folding Stand, which has a deeper slot and the S3 Mini fits perfectly into this stand.Highly recommend this wonderful stand (with the included drawstring carrying bag) and it should work even if you have an non Apple device, IF the depth is thin and it is a newer phone (the new phones are getting thinner and thinner).","overall":5.0,"summary":"Superb Quality - Very Sturdy - No Slipping!

This charger has more power than the other 4 port ones that I have tried in the past. So I do find it plenty fast enough (have not timed it).Most places I find such as hotels, there is just ONE outlet space in which to plug in my devices to charge. Not good.Well this 4 port travel charger to the rescue!Below I list why I prefer this one over my other travel chargers:1) There is a fold up plug (when this is in my travel bag, the electric prongs fold FLAT into the back of this charger so the charger takes up little space in my carry on bag or tote bag. The size with the plug folded is just 3.5 x 2.5 x 1 inch thick!2) Four USB port for charging and the first two have each 2 amps! Just what I require for me two tablets. The second two are 1 amp, one I use for my phone and the other for my Bluetooth keyboard.3) Takes just one outlet! So I plug this in on the BOTTOM outlet so the top outlet can be used for a lamp, or whatever. It is amazing that this item takes up such little space!4) Charging Time - Seems to charge just about as fast as my other single chargers that I use for my tablet and phone if not better and have not found that the 4 outlets slow it down, if does, not much at all. However, I did not time this exactly because during the day and early evening, I keep my tablet and phone charged well, when they go down to about 70 percent or so (after one and a half of HEAVY internet use and WiFi on etc), I plug them back I to charge.*Much of the time, I have just this on the 4 port: Tablet, Phone Bluetooth Keyboard (the Bluetooth Keyboard that I use keeps a full charge for almost 3 days so it is NOT on the charger much. The only time I will use all 4 is when I am on the road and just one outlet is available. This one is the best I tested so far and seems to have plenty of power for 4 items charging at the same time.Highly recommend this charger!","overall":5.0,"summary":"This DiGi 20W 4 Ports USB Wall Charger Charges my Tablet and phone well, great for travel!","unixReviewTime":1392076800,"reviewTime":"2014-02-11T00:00:00"}

Since the manual is small, I am giving you helps here on how to use this should you buy this speaker.Also, I am able to leave my micro SD card in the speaker's slot, I use the MULTI MODE BUTTON to change the mode and also play from this speaker while it is charging.**This unit uses a MINI charger port meaning that any mini USB charger will fit into the port and charge up this speaker. Since I had an extra Motorola Mini USB Wall charger, I plugged this into my unit and it charges it well and it charges very quickly.PROS:+ MULTI MODES AND USES ETC FOR THIS SPEAKER - Bluetooth, Auxiliary and Micro SD Card:1) MP3 Player/SD card mode - To keep the SD card in the unit when it is turned on it will automatically see that there is a card in the unit and play music from the SD card. If you want Bluetooth instead just press and hold DOWN the Play Button, then the Bluetooth with turn on (you will see the blue lights flashing fast so you can then pair and connect without having to remove your SD card.2) Bluetooth Mode. If you Do Not have an SD CARD in the unit, when you turn on the speaker (on the bottom of the speaker) it automatically turns on the Bluetooth mode so you can pair. You will know this because the blue mini lights flash very fast.3) Auxiliary Mode (this is for your Audio cable to listen to a radio or CD Player etc). Step one: Plug in your in and out cable to the speaker and your CD player, radio, etc. You will need to press the Play (multi mode) button and hold it down. The speaker will realize that it has an audio cable in it so it will be ready to play in regular mode in the speaker (like a regular non Bluetooth type of speaker).

They were left on the charger while still turned on and I set my timer at 2 hours 59 minutes. When I returned, both were charged to 100 percent.What I love about this charger is that it is DUAL USB for my tablet and for me phone, it is thin and lightweight (fits well into my purse right along with my tablet and phone). The construction is superb!My unit arrived with just one USB cable that has a USB Micro end and a USB standard end. Since I already had two micro USB cables for the tablet and the phone, this is not a problem.

My HUGE Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos fit into this even with it's semi thick cover on it! (This needs to be FULLY adjusted and to the largest adjustment by holding down the buttons on the left (both) and pulling out the adjustment section).+ Smaller devices fit well into this adjusting the buttons.+ On the left side of the phone holding part is the clip, you just pull up on the clip to release the phone or GPS.+ The adjustment goes back to the smallest adjustment once you remove say a large device (5 inch screen type).+ This comes with: Extra sticky pad to attach to the bottom of this should you need it. This is a SUPER SUPER sticky pad that you can place on your dash or any area where you need more sticky area and more secure holding power! (For places in your car or home that you need extra holding power)!!!! (I used this on my dash to as it is more secure there now).+ Easily removes from the dash to use on a tabletop. What I did is I placed my Grand in this and because the Grand is so large, the Grand easily stands up on the table. You can also use the lever to hold it securely down on a countertop in kitchen or bath.+ Small and compact - I keep this in a clear ziplock bag in my purse so I can use this in any car I am driving or use it on a counter, and I have even used it on my nightstand as a phone stand and it works well as a regular stand!CONS:Just one con: I had to push BOTH buttons on the right side in adjustments to be able to fit my large phone in this.

In 2 seconds, the tablet read this adapter and the 4 flash drives and I was taken over to MyFiles. Then it showed them as USB A, USB B, USB C, USB D.To test this unit, I copied files from one USB flash drive to another and also from the internal space to my flash drives etc.What is so wonderful is HOW FAST my tablet read all 4 flash drives.This read every USB gadget that I placed into it just fine. What I could not get it to do and this NOT the units fault is to be able to read a Portable Hard Drive. This is because the Hard Drive was too high powered and it is limitation of the tablet not the unit itself.What this unit is similar to is a USB 4 port hub that you have for say your laptop, it will read a mouse, flash drives and other USB items like you do when you use your laptop USB adapter for more USB ports.After testing this unit, I will say that BY FAR, this Inateck OTG Adapter is so much better than others I have tried.

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B00JKCH4V2","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"Since I have owned tablets from the Samsung Tab line since the Tab 2, I can still say that in my opinion that Samsung makes a excellent and wonderful tablet with this Tab 4 Eight! It arrived with  Kit Kat onboard so I am delighted! If you are looking a high quality eight inch tablet, this may very well be the one for you! For me I found that this tablet has that WOW, WOW, WOW Factor. So below, I am listing the many Pros I personally have found while using this tablet:PROS:+ Overall Speed And Performance and Android Kit Kat OS:With the fast 1.2  GHz Quad processor,  Since I owned the Samsung Tab 3 8.0 before, I have noticed faster loading, this tablet runs ultra smooth and very, very responsive!  Love that this tablet has 16GB Internal memory.If you have used a Samsung Galaxy device as S3, S4, S5, Note 3, or other Galaxy type, you will love the OS and the familiar Samsung Touch Wiz interface on this tablet. However, what if you have never used Android OS or even a Samsung device? No worries, as this tablet is easy to learn in my opinion.+ SCREEN SIZE IS JUST RIGHT SIZE - VERY CLEAR/SHARP SCREEN FOR READING eBooks or VIEWING WEBPAGES. (Screen in my opinion is large and has superb clarity/clearness for reading eBooks and webpages as the print is so readable as I find it VERY CLEAR/VIVID. This is a great in-between size tablet to use. And I found that the screen was large enough to read webpages easily or watch videos. The screen has a PPI (pixels per inch) of 189, which renders a crisp and clear screen and I found that the colors are super vivid and very colorful.Portability - Excellent as I use a combo MoKo stand-cover-case on it and it is easy to place into my purse or any bag as it is so easy to carry anywhere!+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - It is said that you can add a 64gb SD card for personal files. In my case, I have a 32GB SD card and still have plenty of room after my songs, files and photos are added. (A 64 GB card has different formatting and I have not used this size, just the 32GB) About SD Cards: Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from the Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area. This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way where storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Setting up WiFi and keeping a great signal and long distance WiFi strong signal is one superb feature on this tablet. So I compared the signal strength with the Tab 4 vs my regular Android phone. The Tab 4 had about 35% stronger signal then the phone. I believe it is because there is a very strong WiFi receiver in this tablet. At home or on the road, I am able to connect to many free WiFi hotspots very easily with great signal strength.****Do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a WiFi range? Ask me about this as I have written an article on how to do this using a MiFi type of service from different service providers (please ask in the comment section for more info).+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a OK app for reading Office documents, however, I prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player, this is a free App from Playstore and it plays every home video I tried). Also MX Video Player is very good, however, I prefer QQ Player.+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" are really OK. Better with good quality headphones or a BlueTooth Speaker. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free called WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is SUPERB!+ Battery Life- For me, I noticed that this model the Tab 4, has better battery life than my older Tab 3 eight! Excellent, so far, however, this is what I have found: When I am on WiFi, I go to the websites I need and then as soon as I am done (reasonable time), I exit the browser (or YouTube, etc) and TURN OFF WiFi. However, I run my brightness at 100%. So this seems to keep the battery going longer.+ Kindle App - I installed the Kindle App and synced my Kindle books. Began to read a new book and was very impressed with how exceptional the book rendered using this Tab 4 8.0. Very impressed as the text was very crisp and clear.+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go Micro USB adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab 4). I already had one from my Samsung phone and it works great on the Tab. You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab 4 as I discovered when I tried to read my hard disks via OTG in the Tab 4. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab 4 and from Tab 3 to PC--what a time-saver.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices as well as Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth Stereo Headsets, Bluetooth speakers (all I tried) and copied files at a great rate of speed. SUPERB and FAST Bluetooth.+ Screenshots: There is no ICON for screenshots, however, to take a quick screenshot, hold down home button and power button (at the same time), and then it will take a beautiful screenshot. You can find your screenshot in MyFiles, Internal Storage, Pictures, and Screenshots. I use this sometimes for a map on the internet it saves time and this way it is SAVED for later viewing when I am offline.+ MICRO USB PORT - No more having to use the old type of (non standard) USB charger/cable that the Tab 2 line had. However, this tablet requires a 2 AMP USB Charger to charge the tablet so it will not charge on a standard 1 AMP (phone charger) as I tried and only the 2 AMP one will work. This tablet uses the same Micro 2 AMP type of chargers that the Galaxy Note 8 uses.CONS:-  Camera - The 3MP rear camera on this Tab 4 8.0 and it not as good of a camera as the older Tab 3 line. Also, there is no flash on the camera, yet there are several helpful modes to enhance your shots. For me, I use Auto mode. And I tried the camera and video and was happily surprised in the quality (that is for outdoor shots) - it is pretty good. However, I will continue to use my regular camera for serious picture taking and videos.-  New Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play and they even play in the stock browser.* Bottom line/My Suggestions to You: Would I buy this WiFi only model over again? Yes because this Tab 4 8.0 is lightweight, easy to hold in ONE HAND, and it just as easy to hold as the Tab 4 7 inch, yet has so much more screen real-estate than the Tab 4 7 inch and clarity etc, for just a few dollars more, this is a MUCH BETTER BUY! And I have found because the screen is so crisp and clear, it reads internet pages CLEARER, Home Videos are larger and much clearer to see etc. And the 8 inch is so easy to pop into a briefcase, bag or purse etc than say a large 10 inch is...if you travel and want to go light, may I suggest this Tab 4 8.0 to you!-Since I am somewhat of a techie person, I will be glad to answer any questions that you may have. Just ask in the comment section and I will answer promptly.","overall":5.0,"summary":"Tab 4 8.0 - Excellent Tablet and Just the Right Size - A Detailed Review","unixReviewTime":1404432000,"reviewTime":"2014-07-04T00:00:00"}

This stand has the most adjustments for any stand that I have ever used.+ Charging my devices in this stand (and using them at the same time) - Since there is no open space on the bottom of this stand in which to insert a charger, I just place my phone or tablet in landscape and keep it in the stand and charge it this way. Then I can still use the stand (in landscape) while it is charging when it is in need of a charge).+ Sturdiness / Build Quality / Appearance - Because this stand is heavier than most other stands, and the fact that it is wider than most stands, plus the rubber grippers on the bottom of the stand, it will not slide around like most other stands do. Since the color is silver, it has that more professional and classy appearance when sitting on your desk at work or in a home office etc. This case has that classy designer look totally!+ Devices I tested that fit into this stand (including my Tab 3, Tab Pro and Tab 4 which all fit perfectly in portrait and landscape perfectly in this stand). **I tested these tablets and they had no TPU cover, just the tablet with no case on it. This stand is made for tablets and phones with no cases attached to them.Here is what I tested* Samsung Galaxy S5 (my neighbor&#8217;s phone) - YES even with a silicone cover on the phone - the phone fit almost all the way down to the bottom of this case (there is just very tiny gap that I noticed when looking sideways at the fit). However, because this stand has an inside all rubber gripper on it, my S4 fit into this securely even with the silicone cover. **It will not fit in devices that you have an Otterbox though. Good news! If you have a barely there case or no case on it, it will go all the way down into the stand in portrait mode.It does go all the way down in the stand in landscape mode.* Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos - With a barely there back type of case (thin cover) on it fits most of the way down, but down enough in the slot to feel secure. If no case is on the Grand, it fits in portrait all the way down into the stand. In landscape with the thin case on it, it fits all the way down into the slot in this stand. It will not fit if you have an Otterbox on the Grand.* Samsung Galaxy S3 - Fits well with a slim barely there back case. Fits well without a case.* Samsung Galaxy S2 - In portrait mode: With a slim barely there cover, it went part of the way down into the slot and felt secure. With a TPU case or silicone case, it kind of went down, but not as secure as I liked. Without a case, however, it went all the way down into the slot. In landscape and in barely there cover, it did go most of the way down with the slim barely there back case.* Samsung Galaxy Player 4.2 with barely there back case. Fits perfectly and goes all the way down into the slot on this stand.* Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 - Without a case, this player fit most of the way down into the slot in Portrait mode. With a thin, barely there type of cover, no, it did not fit well in portrait mode, yet in landscape mode, it went all of the way down in the slot even with a cover on it.* Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (without a TPU cover). The tablet fit very well into this stand and went fully into the slot both in portrait and landscape positions. Since the Tab 3 7.0 and 10.1 are thin in depth, they should fit fine as well.* Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (both the 7 and 10) tested both (without any TPU cover) and each one fit perfectly into the slot in portrait and in landscape.* Samsung S4 MINI - I tried this both with a TPU cover and with no cover and there is NO WAY that I would recommend this phone with this stand because of the very rounded edges design of the S3 Mini. If you own this phone and need a stand, then I suggest this one: iKross Universal Folding Stand, which has a deeper slot and the S3 Mini fits perfectly into this stand.Highly recommend this wonderful stand (with the included drawstring carrying bag) and it should work even if you have an non Apple device, IF the depth is thin and it is a newer phone (the new phones are getting thinner and thinner). My true rating is 4.5 stars rounded off to 5 stars. I took of  star because this stand could have had a wider place for phones that have a TPU cover on them.Unit provided by Alaska Bear in exchange for my unbiased review. And I am very happy to report that I am currently using this stand now as it is very sturdy and does not tip over like some of the plastic stands do&#8230;","overall":5.0,"summary":"Superb Quality - Very Sturdy, Heavy duty stand - No Slipping!

{"reviewerID":"ABDR6IJ93HFIO","asin":"B00K0NRVNG","reviewerName":"Daisy \"Daisy S\"","helpful":[62,70],"reviewText":"This wonderful unlocked Moto E Phone I am delighted with as for the low price that I paid, it has far surpassed my expectations in a smartphone! Since I own a HUGE five inch Samsung Galaxy Grand, this phone I find just perfect for travel and it is so easy to hold due to the curved back. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Battery Life - Simply AMAZING - the absolute best battery life of any smartphone or tablet that I have owned! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc).  However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 20 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight. *The very long battery life is what sold me on this phone. Too many times in the past with phones that have too many bells and whistles, the battery ran out so quickly. However, this phone lasts me all day until I go to bed when it goes back on it's charger!+ Built in slip proof anti slip (bumper) cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back, that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I have my eye on a book style cover for this phone already!The back of this phone removes you you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc.+ Screen Resolution - AMAZING! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful!And the screen is so clear that I can read PDF books using Adobe Reader and see the pages without my glasses!+ KitKat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that KitKat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with KitKat that I love, but they have bloatware on them, this phone does not). It received the Kit Kat update to 4.4.3 soon after I purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - The strongest WiFi yet of any phone that I have owned, and I really am serious! This phone has Very, very fast connect and it keeps the connect. In fact in the back of my home (the furthest from my router), I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected at the same time to the router, and there is no loss in speed.+ External SD Card Information - Since this phone has an external SD slot, I installed my 32GB SanDisk Micro Class 4 Micro SD card and it installed and has worked just fine on this Moto phone. Note that some people who own 32GB or higher SD cards with Class 10 have had their phones sometimes give them error message: SD Card unexpectedly removed. This is NOT the fault of the phone. As I have researched this extensively, my findings have stated that it because a smartphone or tablet reads a class 4 or Class 6 card better. However, just some people have this problem with a class 10 card, but for me, I stick with the class 4 SD card and have never encountered this problem on this phone or on any phone or tablet that I have used.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+  Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest Rocket Music Player (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound from this player is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging ever!CONS:- The new Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play).- No flash on the 5MP Camera. This is a lower end camera, I suggest that you use your regular camera for the best picture taking situations. However, to test this camera, I took several outdoor shots as well as a few indoor shots (in bright lighting) and to my amazement, the pictures looked OK, and good enough to email and keep, yet I will be taking my regular digital camera for more serious camera shots.-- Somewhat Low internal storage (but not a problem). The good news is that if an App has KitKat standard and it is newer updated app, then it can be move onto the External SD Card. I was able to move more than half of my installed apps so I still have 1.5GB left on my internal space!- No NFC and NO OTG - This phone will not work with an OTG Adapter with flash drive and other USB devices. This is not a problem as I use Dropbox for sending pictures, etc. No NFC (Near Field Communication) - I do not use this so this is not a problem for me.Bottom line: Would I buy this Moto E phone over again? Yes, I certainly would buy this phone again because it is easy to use, SUPERB battery life, as well as simple to operate. If you are looking for a easy to use and low cost Android smartphone that has really great battery life, let me suggest this phone to you.

After that brief experiment, I took the time to fully charge the power bank so I could fully charge up my iPad and a few other devices I have.  It does have intelligent design and the LED display will flash, indicating where it's at.  Even if you aren't using the device, it's wise to charge it at least once a month to keep things up to snuff.Obviously with 7000 mAh, powering up things like Smartphones, Kindles, iPhones, and things like your GPS are a given.  Take for example, my NOOK, which was at that critical battery level.  In other words, dead as a bag of nails because I never use it.  I didn't keep a close watch on it as I charged it with the New Trent, but it was fully charged within fifteen minutes.  If you do want a battery charger, but don't need quite as much juice, you may wish to consider the popular, sleek New TrentiTorch 5200 mAh external battery charger.When I head out to the library or travel, inevitably I never manage to be first on the scene.  The plug hogs are always reluctant to give up their territory.  Like never.  If I want to catch a few instructional or music videos on YouTube, the battery on my iPad can rapidly deplete.  I love this New Trent and the 7000 mAh has the power to rapidly bring my iPad back up to a percentage I'm comfortable with.  Unlike the NOOK which I never use, I'm always using my iPad.Similarly to my experience with my NOOK, when I charged my iPad it was a more than satisfactory experience.  The iPad battery was down to an 84% capacity and within a half hour I was fully charged.  Some devices can be prone to using a lot of power and my iPad is one of them.  What do I like the most?  It has to be the built-in cables.  They're definitely innovative and tuck in flush to the sides of the power bank.

It brings Bluetooth to your Iphone or iPod touch (2nd generation) so you can not only listen to your favorite tunes, but also accept incoming calls . . . no more struggling to remove headphones and make an inconvenient switch. There are any number of reasons why individuals would want to purchase the Jabra Clipper, but what I wanted it for the most was to enhance an active lifestyle. If you jog, bike, or hike you're going to love the convenience. When I mention \"bike\" I'm primarily referring to off road as using the noise-blocking ear buds can present a safety hazard.Pairing (or unpairing) with an iPhone is a quick and seamless process. For those who are not high tech oriented, directions, complete with a couple of illustrations are quite clear. The instructions are printed in English, Franais, Portugus, and Espa&ntilde;ol. If you still have a problem online support is readily available as is phone support (toll-free numbers in both Canada and the U.S., 24/7). Before you purchase the Jabra Clipper you may need to update your software(3.0 or later) for the Apple iPhone 3G & 3GS and iPod touch (second generation) in order to receive Bluetooth. There is a small manual included specific to Apple products.PROS:* It has rain and shock resistance that meets U.S. military standards/regulation. If you are planning on using the Jabra Clipper when engaging in an active lifestyle, this is a real plus.* Easy pairing, unpairing with the iPhone or other Bluetooth devices.* Bluetooth status can easily be seen via a Bluetooth icon on the iPhone (you can also see if you are not connected, turned off, or are out of range)* It supports the Advance Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP). You have high quality audio with this device.* You won't be missing any calls as it has an incoming call alert and a mobile distance alert.* Once fully charged (check out the instructions on making sure you charge correctly) you're good to go for up to six hours.* The Jabra Clipper can be used with other headphones should you prefer (3.5 mm headphone jack). This is a great feature for when you simply want to sit back at home enjoying your tunes.* There is up to eight days standby time.* The small size will enable you to clip it in many places on your clothing or things like a backpack for a hands-free experience. This is especially nice when you are biking, hiking, or when you are active at a gym.* You can use remote control to control your musical experience. \"Play/pause, skip track, volume up/down (AVRCP),\" etc.* The ear buds provided are sound blocking. You will receive three different sizes in this package.* Great support system that can be accessed via toll-free numbers or online.CON:According to an insert in the box you cannot return your Jabra Clipper to your point of purchase. You need to go through Jabra Support. I'm uncertain if this return policy is applicable to Amazon as they have an excellent return policy that can't be beat.I'm quite pleased with this set and would recommend it highly. I've talked to a few people about the set and each one has expressed an interest in the set for many different reasons. Anyone from a Mom who simply wants to listen to a few tunes while taking a baby for a stroll to the person who is planning to use them on vacation will be excited about the benefits the Jabra Clipper has to offer.

I'm very rigorous when it comes to testing and this case lived up to everything it claimed.  AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Sprint are providing the smartphone, but if you want protection for your phone at a very reasonable price I'd highly recommend Acase.  The Superleggera PRO is a dual layer protective case with a rubberized silicone case and a polycarbonate snap-on case.Peanut butter.  You can't get much greasier and grimy than a peanut butter smear, which went directly onto the polycarbonate case.  Yes, it did settle in briefly, but when I took a damp cloth it readily wiped off without leaving a residue.  Needless to say, my fingerprints did not show up on either case.  Acase's \"anti-fingerprint\" claim surprisingly passed my test as did the \"anti-scratch\" one.  Writing utensils, fingernails, and drops didn't scratch it, let alone dent it.Newstribe calls the Galaxy S3 the \"most powerful smartphone in the world,\" but it will be useless without adequate protection.  The silicone rim is slightly higher than the phone so when place on a table it is less likely to scratch your screen.  The dimensions of the phone are136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6 mm and the lip of the silicone case raises it up sufficiently.  I like the double layer \"armor\" and the sleek black look.  If you prefer another color this case comes inwhite,purple/black,blue/black, andred/black.  Simply click on the color and you'll be taken to the order/description page.

The polycarbonate (PC) outer shell is tough and impact-resistant. Polycarbonate will scratch, but the application of Japanese paint has obviously remedied that situation. Japanese paints are among the best in the world and you really can't tell that the case is \"painted.\" Nice choice and it gives the shell a sleek look.  There is some flexibility to the outer case, which I would foresee that in a drop situation would give just the right amount of give.  Of course there are those freak accidents that happen and not even the best cases can't help.The inner silicone layer not only should be tear-resistant, but will also help cushion the iPhone in the event of an accidental drop. Screen protectors are out there and a good option if you care to protect your screen from scratches.  I have several Acase cases for an assortment of electronic equipment, including the iPad mini.  The iPhone is .30 inch thick (7.6 mm) and nestles nicely in the silicone skin.  As usual, their cut-outs/covers are spot on, in this case for the iSight camera, the Lighting connector (dock connector), the speaker/microphone openings, off/on sleep/wake button, ring/mute, and volume buttons (up/down).I noticed that the cover for the Lightning connector goes slightly in, a good feature that will keep the dust and dirt out.  I think a bit of good thinking went into the design for the silicone skin.  This type of silicone is also known to be tear-resistant, something that is a must with all the open areas on the skin.  The Acase logo in blindstamped into the lower front center.  I have the white, black, and carol green cases and my personal preference is for the green.  These cases are anti-fingerprint and anti-scratch (I tried).  One thing I didn't like was the slightly sharp edges where the openings are.  Perhaps Acase could have beveled them a bit, but I'm not sure.  They did not design the phone and have to design their cases according to what they have to work with.

Not having a recognizable brand name shouldn't be a deterrent, but it's working with the unknown that sometimes makes me shy away from trying anything new.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the performance and the fact that the battery pack came with a 30-pin cable for the iPad.  I'm always worried I'll lose mine and receiving another was an unexpected bonus.When I go anywhere I like to take along a battery pack just in case there are what I call plug hogs around (inevitable) or the power goes out.  Carrying along a battery pack is just a bit of extra insurance I like to have.  This 10000mAh battery pack can charge up two devices at once, but I always prefer to see how they can perform when charging up an iPad.  If a battery pack can charge an iPad, no doubt it can charge small devices or things like an iPhone or smartphone.  The EasyAcc performed marvelously and actually, better than I expected it to.

Mind you, I didn't sit on it watching it every second as it charged, but was quite surprised at how rapidly this 10000mAh was able to power it up without dumping its own charge at a rapid pace.  At just under 3\" x 5 1/3\" it's slightly larger than many battery packs, but is quite sleek and easy to hold in my hand.  The edges are tapered and the price, not unlike similar battery packs is quite reasonable.

Most of the battery packs I test tend to be black, but if you like white this is a nice change. The charge is indicated by four LED lights on the side. The directions indicate that there are five LEDs, but there are only four (the directions are for an 11000mAh battery). With five ports you can charge several devices at once if you have to.  Optimally this battery would work best with by only charging a couple of devices at once if you are trying to charge a power hog like an iPad and a phone, but it would work quite nicely if you were trying to charge several devices that drew smaller amounts of power.It's a sleek unit with a lot of power and I knew that charging my iPad would be a quick and easy proposition. It wasn't seriously depleted, but at a 49% charge it had a way to go. With any battery pack I do a simple and somewhat informal test to see how well a battery pack can perform.  I tried out the EC 13000mAh power bank which would be a battery of choice if you need one to power up a tablet on a regular basis, but I'd select this one if using one for several smaller devices such as iPhones, iPods, smartphones, Kindles, etc.I liked the presentation of this battery and the other EC I tested. Many of them simply come in small boxes that you'd open up and immediately start using. This is one that I might select as a gift. The connectors are laid out nicely side-by-side and the cables have their own spot in a recessed section. The price of this one is most certainly reasonable, considerably less than some I've tested in a similar mAh range.

Travel can be a nightmarish proposition when I have to make sure I have multiple cords for those I-gotta-just-have-this-with-me devices.

I would have liked to see something like a faux-suede pouch to keep the connectors in, but there is a small Ziplock-style bag to hold them.If you'll be on-the-go with the Incredicharge, you might want to be proactive and find something to hold multiple connectors.

For example, there are several vendors for many of the items I've provided clickable links for.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:*  The Incredicharge I-8800*  A connector for the Apple iPhone 3GS, Apple iPhone 4s, or an Apple iPad*  A connector for theSamsung Galaxy S3*  Another connector for Samsung phones*  A connector for theNokia N8*  A Micro-USB Connector*  A Mini-USB Connector*  A connector for PSP*  An AC charger*  A USB Power Cable (for charging other small devices)*  A user manual (actually a pamphlet)SPECS (From the user manual):* Battery Capacity:  880mAh*  Battery Type:  lithium-ion*  Rated Output:  DC 5V, 2.1 A*  Rated Input:  DC 5V, 2.1  A*  Charging Time:  0 to 7 hours*  Working Temperature:  0 degrees C to 40 degrees C*  Storage Temperature:  Minus 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C*  Working Humidity:  Less than or equal to 90 degrees*  Storage Humidity:  65 degrees to 20 degrees*  Product Dimensions:  3\" W x 4 1/2\" L x 1\" C (109 x 77.3 x 25.5mm)*  Net weight:  0.5291094 lb.

It's a little bonus feature that I appreciated.  One of my favorite devices I charged up was my Kindle, a device with a super-duper long cord that I have to keep separately because it doesn't fit in my Kindle case.Aside from my petty comment on the lack of a small case to put the accessories in, I would have liked to see some rubberized feet on the bottom because if you place it on a solid surface it will slide.  The charger surface picks up oils from my hands and smudges quickly.  I'm reviewing the charger itself, not my desire for a perfect product and no doubt, the Incrdicharge I-8800 is a versatile product well worth investing in, especially if you have numerous portable devices you work with.This product courtesy of Incredicharge without expectation of a positive review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"This versatile Incredicharge I-8800 is an excellent charger for the on-the-go person with multiple devices that need charging ..","unixReviewTime":1346716800,"reviewTime":"2012-09-04T00:00:00"}

If you're one of those people who is always charged up and can make do with your regular plug-in charger, don't bother.  If you're like me and a few of my other friends who are always claiming your battery is running low and you only have a minute to talk, this might be an item you want to consider.  I'm the type who always has a Kindle to charge, a Nook that is out of juice, and should definitely have an easy-to-use charger like the Durcell Powermat.

This is a little bit of a hassle, but understandable.The portable battery is a real asset, especially especially if you aren't home during the day and need a fully-charged phone.  Some of the battery chargers are quite clunky and it's not feasible to tote them in your purse or pocket.  This little charger is 2 3/4\" x 2 3/4\" and is a slim 3/4\" in depth.  One thing I would have liked to see is a small case for this as dirt and dust just love to invade crevices.  The backup power, however, is a real plus for on-the-go people.  It has two connectors, one for a micro usb and the other for an Apple connector.  These nestle right into either side of the battery.Charging is simple and almost intuitive once you've seen any powermat in use.  It's one of those drop and go types of mats, but you do need to get the hang of alignment (simple).  You will hear a light \"bleep\" when it's begun to charge and, as usual, your phone or other device will indicate that it is indeed being charged.Do I like it and would I buy it?  Yes and yes.  I only have a couple of minor quibbles with it, which I've already mentioned.  I'm waiting for the additional technology that will allow charging of the phone in public places and in some cars.

This one is simple sans a lot of frills.  The only \"extra\" is a nylon lanyard tucked inside the case.  There are all kinds of cases out there that even have earphone jacks so you can listen to your music while you run or walk.  This is one that protects your phone while you're outside boating, riding your bike, or hiking.  It's see-through on both sides so you can leave your phone on to see if any messages are coming through.One nice thing is that this case actually floats.  I tried it out in the sink and when I opened it up it was as dry as a bone.  I did wipe off the exterior before opening just to make sure I wouldn't accidentally flip some moisture inside.  When you kayak or canoe there's no guarantee you're going to stay upright.  If you go over (it happens) you're not going to lose your phone in the bottom of a lake or river.  You won't be trying to explain to a cell phone guy, who has no sympathy, that there is something wrong with your phone when you drenched it.The clear plastic is stiff, but not so stiff you cannot effectively use your touchscreen.  You just have to press a bit harder to access it.  If you want to take a picture, you won't have to try to carefully position your iSight or other camera because there's clear access on both sides.  Not that you'll be taking a lot of pictures while your camera is encased in this case, but at least you'll have the option.  If you want to protect your phone, this is the Fort Knox of waterproof cases.FEATURES:~  Devices can be used for up to 20 meters under water~  Easily floats on water (I tried this)~  Clear transparent and soft material for easy operation~  100%  protection from water, sand, and dust~  ABS clip and PVC material which can resist acidic conditionsOne cautionary note I'd throw out there is that you really should pay attention to the directions on how to open the case.  If you don't do so properly, I suspect it would be quite easy to break the snaps.  Inserting your phone or other item should be done carefully as well.  This type of item is only as good as you make it.  It's not intended to take a lot of abuse or misuse.

Usually when I check out a car charger there are no accessories to be had and I did like this innovative change. The cords of course, are generic, but appear to be of high quality. Some amount of thought went into this package deal. Keep in mind that although there are three Apple cords, there is not one for the iPhone5. You'll simply have to provide your own.The charger is quite solidly made and the spring-loaded contacts hold it nicely when you insert it into the socket. Although it has three ports, you cannot charge three tablets or one phone and two tablets at once. I should say that Ideal recommends against doing so. My recommend would be to check out the dimensions before purchasing (listed below). The charger is definitely solid and stable, but the length may be problematic in some vehicles.This does have \"over voltage, over current, over charge, and short circuit protection.\" In order to prevent draining your battery, this is an on-the-go charger ... in other words, unless you want to be calling AAA, don't try to charge any devices when you are not moving that vehicle.

I simply used the provided USB cable, plugged it into the Micro USB Input on the charger, and then plugged it into my PC for an overnight charge.  By morning it was fully charged and ready to go.  I've had one portable battery before and do have theYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery.  If you really need some power you might want to consider this Power Bank as it's a real power horse that I'm using with my biggest power hog, the iPad.  It will also charge a couple of devices simultaneously.The 5200 mAh Yubi is no slouch in the power department, but I'm using it primarily for items that don't draw or demand massive amounts of power.  Think Smartphones, Kindles, your GPS, or iPhone.  This Yubi is perfect to leave at work or take with you when you are heading to the library, a bookstore, or anywhere else where you'll need it and don't have access to a plug.  Those critters are out there, but I never manage to be the first one on the scene and once someone is using a plug in a Wi-Fi accessible area, they're reluctant to give them up.Portable devices aren't any good if you can't charge them up and this Yubi is perfect.  It's not only portable, but quite compact.  The LED flashlight is a total bonus, especially if you need a bit of light when you're heading to your car or trying to spot something when the lights go out.  Little touches such as this one are always appreciated.  I do like the accessories, but generally use the ones provided with any particular device I'm using.  The Yubi is high-performance and charged up my Kindle and Kindle Fire as quickly and readily as if I'd plugged it into an outlet in my house.  Good to go on-the-go is an important factor to a lot of us.Needless to say, I've been impressed and pleased with both of my Yubi Power Banks.  If you do need more than 5200 mA, simply check out the very compact and equally affordableYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery.  This Yubi purportedly has life cycle of more than 500 charges.  Durability and long-lasting items are a big plus in my department.  A friend carries a Power Bank to work to keep his phone fully charged.  The Yubi is one of those devices that is powerful, but can fit in the palm of one's hand, can be slipped into a pocket or purse, or into a carrying case.

The exterior of this Collatio case is two-tone with a rich medium brown on the spine and a red wine brown leather for the remainder. There is a small tasteful Acase logo button in the lower right-hand front.  Although leather is not for everyone, I was immediately drawn to the look as it is reminiscent of many vintage clutches and purses that were once very popular.  This case, however, is definitely unisex in design and no doubt will be appreciated by anyone who purchases it.  The inside lining is an orange brown suede.  There are three leather credit card slots and sufficient space behind them to tuck a bit of cash or a few notes.I've reviewed many Acase cases, all of which tend to be spot on with the cuts.  Leather, however, presents a slightly different problem.  Unlike polycarbonates there is a bit of a shift with leather that one must get used to.  The cutouts for the iSight camera, sleep/wake button, Lightning Connector, headphone jack, and the ringer/mute switch are excellent.  The leather surrounding the iPhone 5 will need to be shifted a bit until it actually adjusts to your phone.  Think shoes here ... it takes a while even for leather to adjust to a phone.  The only iffy spot is for the ringer/mute button.  Because of the thickness of the leather you may have to use your fingernail at first.  The volume button locations are blindstamped into the leather and simply pressing them works.This is a beautiful case that will add a definite touch of class to your iPhone 5.  Obviously you'll want to add a screen protector, especially if you put credit cards into the slots.  Your screen just might be a bit unforgiving.  There are all kinds of adequate screen protectors out there, including one offered by Acase, but  MPREO  is offering a5 Pack of Screen Protectorsat a fairly reasonable price right now.  I have another brand, but this one seems have been fairly well-received by customers.  The Collatio genuine leather case not only is functional, but will also offer up a lot of protection for your phone.  Of course there are those freak accidents, but the all-around thick leather should definitely be a plus.  The stitching is perfect on mine, but as I mentioned before, leather is a bit finicky.  Altogether, I really love it and the photograph doesn't do the case justice as the richness of the leather looks a bit washed out.

When removing the stickers from their paper storage holder, simply slip the tip of your fingernail beneath one edge and pull lightly. The easiest way to position the sticker is to lick your pointer finger to get it into the position you want, carefully apply, and press it down.If you miss and get it into a position you don't like, simply pull the sticker off and start again.  Some people are actually collecting these reusable stickers to personalize their iOS devices.  The FRIEQ home button stickers are quite functional in one regard.

For a bit I was trying to figure out what I was doing wrong because when I unplugged it from the wall after pairing it to my iPad the connection was cut. Yes, you can &#34;connect your phone or other smart device to your stereo or music system wirelessly,&#34; but there's a catch here. You have to keep the Belkin plugged into the wall all the time if you want to do so.Just for the heck of it I decided to call customer service. This always tells me a lot about how I'm going to fare with a product if something goes wrong. The first person I talked to on the phone was awesome, put me on hold for a minute (no longer) to query my question and got back to me. Mind you, I couldn't understand a word he said, but he did refer me to the proper number. Godfrey, who sounded like he would rather be doing anything but working for Belkin, was able to answer my question. Yes, you have to keep the unit plugged in. Customer service is a big part of a product's package. Belkin ... well, you'll get your answer, but don't count on any pleasantries. None.Back to the Belkin HD Bluetooth Music Receiver. Once I figured out what I was doing wrong, I was up and going quickly. The video is a relatively simple one that shows how you can easily set up the Belkin to your stereo system. I'm using the EXOGEAR for demonstration purposes so you can see the Belkin hard at work next to it. I'm streaming music from my iPad. Now, you can easily do this with several other Bluetooth music receivers, but that's where the comparison stops. The Belkin offers more, quite a bit more actually.What the difference the Belkin HD Bluetooth music receiver has to offer is the ability to work with not just one Bluetooth enabled device, but eight of them. I tried pairing one other music receiver to a Samsung Galaxy, which was compatible, but got kicked back to the iPad. It didn't have the capability that the Belkin has. When it's plugged in, you're using your house as a conduit for signal I believe. At any rate, the Belkin is a performer, a champion.

That sort of practice and lint-free cloths will get you nowhere fast.When I used one of these screen cleaning pads on my iPad this morning I was amazed at the results.  It was like the Magic Eraser of the screen cleaning pad family.  It was a no hassle clean and a couple of swipes completely cleaned the screen.  There was no residue left behind and whatever oils the Frieq cleaned off appeared to be absorbed into the microfiber.  While I was at it, I added aFrieq Home Button Stickerto my iPad for good measure.  A good cleaning and a pretty in purple aluminum sticker made my iPad look as good as new.  The Frieq screen cleaning pads will fit all hands, using two or more fingers, and are easy to store.~  Premium microfiber material.~  Soft and comfortable, reusable.~  Easy to grip and use.~  Cleaning solution not required.~  Effectively removes fingerprints and residue from screen.~  Works with Cell Phone, LCD, Mp4, PSP, iPad, and most touchscreen tablets.~  Specifications:  5.12 x 3.15 inches (13cm x 8cm)~  Recyclable packaging.Sample provided for review from the distributor.","overall":5.0,"summary":"These premium microfiber screen cleaning pads are as handy as a Magic Eraser ...","unixReviewTime":1362614400,"reviewTime":"2013-03-07T00:00:00"}

I simply used the provided USB cable, plugged it into the Micro USB Input on the charger, and then plugged it into my PC for an overnight charge.  By morning it was fully charged and ready to go.  I've had one portable battery before and do have theYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery.  If you really need some power you might want to consider this Power Bank as it's a real power horse that I'm using with my biggest power hog, the iPad.  It will also charge a couple of devices simultaneously.The 5200 mAh Yubi is no slouch in the power department, but I'm using it primarily for items that don't draw or demand massive amounts of power.  Think Smartphones, Kindles, your GPS, or iPhone.  This Yubi is perfect to leave at work or take with you when you are heading to the library, a bookstore, or anywhere else where you'll need it and don't have access to a plug.  Those critters are out there, but I never manage to be the first one on the scene and once someone is using a plug in a Wi-Fi accessible area, they're reluctant to give them up.Portable devices aren't any good if you can't charge them up and this Yubi is perfect.  It's not only portable, but quite compact.  The LED flashlight is a total bonus, especially if you need a bit of light when you're heading to your car or trying to spot something when the lights go out.  Little touches such as this one are always appreciated.  I do like the accessories, but generally use the ones provided with any particular device I'm using.  The Yubi is high-performance and charged up my Kindle and Kindle Fire as quickly and readily as if I'd plugged it into an outlet in my house.  Good to go on-the-go is an important factor to a lot of us.Needless to say, I've been impressed and pleased with both of my Yubi Power Banks.  If you do need more than 5200 mA, simply check out the very compact and equally affordableYubi 8400 mAh High Capacity Portable Battery. This Yubi purportedly has life cycle of more than 500 charges.  Durability and long-lasting items are a big plus in my department.  A friend carries a Power Bank to work to keep his phone fully charged.  The Yubi is one of those devices that is powerful, but can fit in the palm of one's hand, can be slipped into a pocket or purse, or into a carrying case.  Absolutely no complaints about either one of the Yubi Power Banks I own.  The Yubi 5200 Mah is an awesome little battery I'll get a lot of use out of.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  Yubi power bank (yp520A)~  USB cable - 8.5\" (21.5cm)~  PSP~  Micro USB~  Mini USB~  iPhone /iPad USBSPECIFICATIONS:~  USB Input:  DC 5V 1A~  USB Output:  DC 5V 2.1A Max~  Charging Time:  Around 5-6 hours (via1A adaptor)~  Battery Capacity:  5200 mAh~  Dimensions:  3.94\" x 1.65\" x 0.9055\" (100 x 42 x 23mm)~  Weight: 0.3042 lb.

Keep in mind that water-resistant and waterproof are two different critters.  This is a perfect battery pack to take camping or throw in your backpack when it's a bit misty or damp outside.  The case is a solid, hard plastic with a rubberized shield that closes down over your ports, keeping them safe and dry.  It also is quite handy in that it will keep out any dirt or dust, even if you aren't trying to keep it dry.One of my favorite tests to attempt is a right-out-of-the-box test to see how much power a battery pack really has.  Can it perform as well as it should under less than optimum conditions?  Most batteries are not fully charged when you get them and this one wasn't.  It only was showing two LED lights, indicating that at best it was only at 50% capacity.

If you forget to charge it before you head out anywhere, chances are you'll have enough to easily charge your phones or other devices like your Kindle Fire or even an iPad.  Only thing I could find wrong with it was that because it is black it's a print magnet.  Nothing new there.

When you&#8217;re looking to power up a smartphone or other small device, usually you&#8217;ll want to be around the 3500 to 7000mAh range.  If you need power, the 10000 is usually the starting range you&#8217;ll want to take a look at.I always test my battery packs rather informally using a first generation iPad.  My tests may be informal, but they are also very telling.  The Intocircuit was an incredible performer.  What I look at specifically is how much it charges in the first fifteen minutes and take a general look at it over a short period of time.Yes, it did well in the first fifteen minutes and didn&#8217;t drop a lot of charge during its initial push.  I&#8217;ve had some very nice, supposedly awesome name brands that have lost out during the first fifteen minutes.  The Intocircuit just kept moving right along until my iPad was fully charged.  This was quite an unexpected performance.I&#8217;m not quite sure what my expectations were, but I know what they weren&#8217;t ... I didn&#8217;t expect a full charge from such a depleted iPad.  Every time I checked the Intocircuit continued its charge.  It was doing much better than expected and by the time the iPad was fully charged, I&#8217;m sure I had enough juice left for my Kindle.

When I go on vacation, however, I'm amazed at the number of cords, chargers, and electronic devices I tote around and the Boise will definitely eliminate some of the excess baggage, literally.  It's definitely a solid, well-made charger.  I have seen a generic 10W charger that was cheaply made and it can't come close to the quality of this one.  I especially like the Flip Down AC prongs.  When they are nestled down into the unit they are flush and don't extend beyond the body of the charger.  Conversely, when they are up, they don't wobble and are quite solid.This device simply turns your AC outlet into a charging station.  It's a quad port USB charger, each port labeled to make it easy.  Without the labeling when I look at the unit head on, it's difficult, if not impossible, to visually tell where I'd be plugging in my iPad.  The first two ports are Universal(U), the third iPad/U, and the fourth, Sam/U.  When you've made a proper connection, a blue LED light comes on and remains on.

It's definitely a very unique design with the outline of a football on the front and rear panels. The leather lacing actually gives it a good gripping factor and is very comfortable in the hand. The lacing does not have the vertical center line as it would interfere with the opening and closing with the case and would make it too bulky. The dark vintage brown leather is complimented by a lovely cocoa brown suede interior lining on one side.  The other side, which had a couple of card holders, is also in the vintage leather.  A very solid brown leather lanyard wrist strap (detachable) with a deep vintage-color brass swivel and snap nicely rounds out the look and adds a lot of functionality to the case.The case itself is made of Brazilian buffalo hide, much in line with the footballs made for the NFL. The texture, however is finer. The Wilson football adds their own patented unique \"brand\" to their leather, as Frieq has done to theirs. The distinctive Frieq logo is nicely blindstamped in the lower right-hand corner. The stitching is meticulously done, least ways mine is. The cut-outs are spot on, including the one for the iSight camera.  As this is an open style case, your lighting connector, built-in speakers, lighting port connector, headphone minijack, volume controls, ringer/mute switch, etc. Are easily accessed.

I was very anxious to receive this battery pack to test out its capabilies.  I have several battery packs including one that is 7500mAh.  I want power on-the-go and a battery pack with 10000mAh should do the trick, least ways I was hoping it would.  It didn't come fully charged, but that was where the true test would be.  Just what could this battery pack do with only 50% to 75% of its power left?Turns out it can do quite a bit.  Of course it's going to charge those phones and other small devices, but I really wanted to push this battery.  I had a totally discharged Kindle Fire (as in really dead) and it was up and running within an hour or so.  No issues there, but I had powered down my iPad in anticipation of receiving this battery.

Most of the battery packs come in the standard black or white, but this one is a nice baby blue and white, a nice change.FLASH Performance:Start: 27% (4 LEDs)15 minutes 31% (4 LEDs)30 minutes 35%45 minutes 40%60 minutes 43%75 minutes 46% (3 LEDs)90 minutes 52%115 minutes 56%  (2 LEDs)145 minutes 61%160 minutes 68%  (1 LED)175 minutes 73%190 minutes 77%205 minutes  82%  (flashing)220  minutes 87%The battery finally ran out of juice, but the performance was really impressive for a 5600mAh battery pack.

It finally gave up the ghost, but it really packed an unexpected wallop.  It's a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase. The top of the battery pack has the four LED indicators. Beneath that on the front side is the small LED flashlight, and one output port.  I suspect that LED flashlight would be able to stay on for more than 200 hours continuously given the power of this battery (just a guess). It's small, but would be great in emergency situations. On the right-hand side panel is the micro 5-pin input port.  The power switch is conveniently on the top face.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:1. Power Bank 5600mAh2. PSP connector3. Nokia DC 2.0 connector4.

The last case I reviewed for Acase was a leather one.  It was quite elegant, but needed a bit of breaking in before it would be fully functional.  This one is very user-friendly and you are good to go in a matter of seconds.  It's a simple matter to get the iPhone 5 in the case.  Simply pull apart two sides as if you were looking into a billfold, tuck your iPhone in, and release.  The fit is snug while you have open access to all the ports and features.  There are no specific cut-outs save for the iSight camera.This case definitely passes in the protection department. The polycarbonate (PC) outer shell is tough and impact-resistant. Polycarbonate will scratch, but the application of Japanese paint has obviously remedied that situation. FYI, Japanese paints are among the best in the world. Nice choice and it gives the shell an sleek look, while adding that much-needed protection.  There is a raised front lip around the front edge that will protect the screen if you place in face down on any surface.  Mind you, this will offer up some protection in case of drops, but there are always those freak accidents.The slate gray case has a basket weave raised design that makes it easy to grip.  The edges are beveled, a feature that makes it easier to hold.  The distinctive Acase logo is centered on the lower front.  The polycarbonate shell isn't going to scratch (I tried) nor will fingerprints and dirt adhere to its surface, something that I appreciate.

For one thing it is quite slim, compact, and easy to tuck away in a desk drawer, purse, or briefcase.  I like the power banks that are usually dubbed \"lipsticks,\" but this one is much less clunkier than any of those are.  The most interesting, and perhaps welcome thing about the iFlash, is the fact that it has an internal spring output plug.  At first I thought it was a switch, but was very pleased to note otherwise.  It comes out quite easily when you simply pinch and pull.I instantaneously knew how much power was in the battery when I pressed the button on the top face where the iFlash logo is.  Instead of simple dots or slashes accompanied by numbers, the LED lights are underneath.  The numerical panel lights up nicely with a bright blue.  If you hold the button for a couple of seconds, the mini LED flashlight comes on (reverse the process to turn it off).  I gave this small battery pack a little workout right out of the box.  I tried it out with an iPad, which it certainly isn't meant for, but was getting a surprising  2% to 3% charge every fifteen minutes.  Mind you, this little experiment was undertaken with a battery pack with probably no more than a 74% charge to begin with.This is definitely a high-quality battery pack that is set up for gift giving.  It's in a hard shell, plastic case rather than a box and is very attractive.  The box can either be recycled, use to store the battery pack or used for something else.  I'd never heard of iFlash before testing some of their battery packs, but have definitely been pleased with not only the performance, but also attention to detail.  For example, the cords are of high quality and the plugs fit quite snuggly.  iFlash stands behind their product and is offering a 1-year limited warranty.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  3200mAh power bank~  USB cable~  30-pin connector~  5-pin micro USB connectorSPECS:~ Weight: 92g (.20 pound)~ Capacity:  3200mAh~ Input: DCV/1A~ Output: DC5V/0.6A~ Output charging time:  2 - 3 hours~ Input charging time: 4 - 5  hours~ Recycling time: Unknown (probably around 500 times)~ One year limited warranty~  ROHS and CE certifiedDIMENSIONS:~  107(L)x57(W)x10(T) mm 4.17 x 2.24 x 0.4 inchesPOWER INDICATORS:(These are numerical from 25 to 100)~ Not lit up:  &lt;25%~ One LED light on: 25% - 49% (25)~ Two LED lights on: 50% - 74% (50)~ Three LED lights on: 75% - 99% (75)~  Four LED lights on: 100% (100)OPERATING PARAMETERS:~  Working Temperature:  -20 - 45 C (-4 - 113 F)~  Storage Temperature:  -20 - 60 C (-4 - 140 F)~  Working Humidity:  20% - 80%~  Storage Humidity:  20% - 90%Sample provided for review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"This is a nice slim, high-performance 3200mAh battery pack ...","unixReviewTime":1373846400,"reviewTime":"2013-07-15T00:00:00"}

The range is very good, but I did experience some cutting out which didn't appear to be out of line.  I chalked it up to electromacnetic interference in the area.

Many battery packs have sharp edges, edges that are tapered in this one.  Additionally it's coated in a soft plastic.  Most of the battery packs I test tend to be black, but if you like white this is a nice change.The charge is indicated by four LED lights on the front left-hand side along with the 2A and 1A ports. If you quickly double click the on/off button, you have a very handy emergency flashlight that won't light up a room by any means, but will most certainly allow you to maneuver your surroundings.  I'm always pleased to see this feature because even though at this point in time, after having charged my iPad, the light is still running strong.It's a sleek unit with a lot of power and I knew that charging my iPad would be a true test of the Uhuru!  It was getting close to total discharge with only 7% of its total charge remaining.  With any battery pack I do a simple and somewhat informal test to see how well a battery pack can perform.  If you need a battery pack that is a real performer and can power up your tablet when there is no outlet available, the Uhuru! can cut the mustard.My testing simply consisted of plugging the Uhuru! into my iPad from a right-out-of-the-box manner (using the 2A port).  It was showing four LEDs, but I could have had as little as a 76% charge left.  I was quite pleased, actually impressed with the Uhuru's performance.  I asked a lot from this 12000mAh battery pack and it gave me a lot.  Finally, after 360 minutes, I had drained the battery pack of its remaining charge.  My iPad was fully functional and ready to roll.  Yes, the Uhuru! is most certainly a battery pack you might be interested in looking at, especially if you need a performer.iPad - 7% charge at start30 minutes - 15%60 minutes - 23%90 minutes - 31%120 minutes - 40%150 minutes - 52%240 minutes - 65%300 minutes - 72%330 minutes - 76%360 minutes - 77%WHAT'S IN THE BOX:&#9658;  Gorilla Gadget Uhuru!

My old dual USB port charger was set up with 2.1A and 1.0 ports, but this one is definitely an improvement over the other if you need to charge two tablets at once.  Usually I'll charge many of my devices such as battery packs through my PC, but when I need a rapid charge I've set aside my Bolse for when I need it ... which tends to be frequent.  I do like this charger because it takes the AC charger to a new, more powerful level.The wide range of compatible devices is a real plus because of the wide range we all use.  I like the Bolse name because it spells quality and dependability.  This past week, I didn't hesitate to pull out one of their more powerful battery packs to loan in to someone working outside my home.  They needed a charge for their iPhone5 and needed access to their phone.  In addition to the ability to charge two tablets, I like its compact nature, the flip-down AC prongs, and yes, I like that orange LED light that signals it's charging.

What I immediately noticed when I unboxed the Bolse AON6, was the unusual design.  Most of the more powerful battery packs are shaped like a pack of cards, but this one has a nice ergonomic design that makes it comfortable to hold.  There are no sharp edges and the rounded lengthwise body of this battery pack makes it quite unique.  The extra accessories are always a plus in my book because you never know when you'll need them, for yourself or someone else.This small battery pack really isn't made to power up a tablet, but I always try out a battery pack on one to see just what kind of power they have.  The performance of this little Bolse AON6 5200mAh was absolutely impressive.  Mind you, my tests are informal, but are quite telling.  This battery pack really was a work horse and gave an unexpectedly impressive performance.  If it can actually charge up an iPad this well, it certainly has enough power to charge up a couple of smaller devices readily.The only problem I had, and it is a visual one on my part, was that I had trouble seeing where those LED lights were at.  I simply made sure that I was fully charged overnight before I began.  I plugged it into my PC overnight and was good to go in the morning.

Like the Xtreme sports, this is an Xtreme battery. The first thing that came to mind is that this battery is the OtterBox of all battery packs. It's surprisingly tough and if you don't need anything Xtreme, you just might want to take a pass. If you do need it, you definitely have selected the right battery.I put it through the \"how rugged are you really?\" test. I soaked it and then threw it. No, not a little toss, a throw. It bounced like crazy and rolled like something out of a Nascar accident scene. It hit so hard the door to the ports popped open, but fortunately for me it didn't break off. It is both waterproof and water resistant. Beneath the port door are what I am assuming are silicon inserts that seal the ports when the door is closed.If you are holding the New Trent PowerPak Xtreme in the palm of your hand with the logo to the top right face on the bevel, you will find the power \"button\" on the lower left side beneath the bevel. The door to the ports is on the center front. The ports are labeled on the port door; the 5V1A is on the right, the 5V2.1V on the left. When you press the button the LED lights go on, but will not remain on. They do not flash, but rather are static.And so, how did my PowerPak Xtreme work after being doused and thrown? Quite well, thank you. I was some impressed. I usually do my informal testing with my iPad, but added an iPhone 4 to see what it could do. A 12000mAh battery pack does have a lot of power and gave an impressive performance. All in all, I was mega-satisfied with this battery pack.

This type of battery charger, because of it's small size, has been dubbed a \"lipstick\" charger.  This type of charger is almost intuitive to operate.  On the interfact you have a reset button, a micro USB port, a USB output port, a small reset button, and a LED status indicator.Unlike many of the battery packs, this one does not have LED bars or a digital indicator to let you know how much charge you have left.

The assumption is that you'll be recharging it when you arrive home or at your office.I like the design, a compact and attractive one.

I was pleased because this innovative design will allow the user to know exactly how much juice is left in the battery.  The LEDs are nice but as a rule, you'll only see three or four of them and the range of charge can be wide.  I'm used to working with these batteries and keep them charged up.  However, if you have one and only have 1 LED remaining, you may have a 1% charge or a 24% charge.  If you had a fuel gauge like that in a car, you might be driving on 1/4 of a tank or fumes.  Novel idea and I really liked it.I liked the promise of this battery, as well as the M2, until I started to test them.  I cannot speak for anyone else, but I test every battery I get ... in real-time circumstances.  I use my iPad a lot and when it's powered down sufficiently I start testing.  I figured a 6600mAh battery would be able to do a sufficient job powering up an iPad with a 46% charge remaining. The M3 struggled from the start with an immediate drop in charge from 97% down to 65% in fifteen minutes.  It was then I decided to watch and record very closely what was going on.A casual approach is usually my thing, but instead of a stellar performance I'd expect from a 6600mAh battery pack, I only got an average one.  Bolse is usually a performer, but for some reason the M2 and M3 battery packs fell a bit short of my expectations.  The performance was OK, but nothing more.  If you want a Bolse, which is an excellent brand, I'd look at the AON series, which really performed spectacularly.  I'm rating this one a three, which is OK, on the Amazon scale.Bolse M3 (6600mAh) - 97% charged at startiPad - 46% charge at start15 minutes -  51%  (65%)30 minutes -  56%  (58%)45 minutes -  61%  (55%)60 minutes -  66%  (51%)75 minutes -  71 % (39%)90 minutes -  76%  (37%)120 minutes - 82% (19%)135 minutes - 85%  (LO)150 - The M3 stopped charging at this pointWHAT'S IN THE BOX:~ 1 Bolse M3 External Battery~ 3 connectors~ 1 Micro USB power cable~ 1 velvet-like travel pouch~ Quick start guideSPECS:~ Battery type: Li-ion battery~ Life cycle: ~500 cycles~ Input current:  800mAh~ Output current:Output USB1:  for iPad / iPhoneOutput USB2 for All Smartphones2A total max~ Capacity:  6600mAh~ Size: 4.13 x 2.36 x 0.71 inches~  Weight:  5.76 ounces~  Certifications:  CE & FCC & ROHSWarranty:  12 months limitedSample provided for review.","overall":3.0,"summary":"The M3 has an innovative design with the Smart digital display, but falls short in performance ...","unixReviewTime":1377129600,"reviewTime":"2013-08-22T00:00:00"}

Fowler","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"I&#8217;ve owned and tested a lot of battery pack and have not always been as enamored with the digital display type as some other people. One of the problems I frequently encounter is a very heavy drop in power in the first fifteen minutes. Yes, the OXA 10000mAh did drop in power, but not appreciably so. After the expected drop, it continued to perform quite well. I don&#8217;t run all kinds of tests, but rather run an informal one. I take a first generation iPad, usually with a somewhat depleted battery, to see how well it performs over time.One very interesting feature is that on the digital display, which indicates the percentage of power left in the battery, also indicates which port you are using. For example, I&#8217;m using the 5.0V 2.1A port. This is an important thing to know if you want an optimum speed charge for your device. For example, you won&#8217;t need as much juice for your phone and may wish to use the other port. These are individually labeled, but a bit difficult to see in some lights.A single tap on the button on the flat side above the OXA logo will light up the digital display. Two quick taps will turn the small flashlight on or off, whichever you prefer. The light obviously won&#8217;t light up a room, but will enable you to get around easily if the power goes out. There are four converters, but as a rule I prefer to use the cords that come with my own devices.What it all boils down to is how well the OXA 10000mAh performed. With 10000mAh you can fully expect to charge up a tablet readily, provided it&#8217;s not severely depleted. Overall I was quite satisfied with the performance, something I really didn&#8217;t expect. There are Samsung Digital cells and a premium chipset, which may have made a big difference. The only quibble I have is simply cosmetic. Black is a print magnet and there was a slight bubble beneath my digital display cover, however, I&#8217;m going to use it to charge my devices, not admire it.START:The iPad: 15%The OXA 100%15 minutes: 21% (OXA 87%)30 minutes: 28% (OXA 84%)45 minutes: 34% (OXA 82%)75 minutes: 49% (OXA 60%)90 minutes: 54% (OXA 50%)105 minutes: 60% (OXA 30%)120 minutes: 66% (OXA 24%)135 minutes: 73% (OXA 17%)150 minutes: 78% (OXA 8%)165 minutes: 84% (OXA 4%)180 minutes: 90% (OXA 2%)195 minutes: 95% (OXA 2%)205 minutes: 96% (OXA 0%)FEATURES:&#9658; Samsung Grade A cell and premium chipset ensure high quality&#9658; Above 500+ recharge cycles over the life of the battery&#9658; Digital screen to display the battery status when charging&#9658; 2 USB ports allows to charge 2 devices at the same time&#9658; Built in LED flashlight provides light when you need itSPECS:WHAT&#8217;S IN THE BOX:&#9658; Power bank&#9658; Micro USB wire&#9658; 4 x Phone converter, including 30-pin&#9658; User manual&#9658; Travel pouchSPECS:&#9658; Model: OXA 10000&#9658; Cell type: Li-Polymer battery&#9658; Capacity: 10000mAh&#9658; Input: 5V 1.5A&#9658; Output: USB1: 5V 1A; USB2: 5V 2.1A&#9658; Size: 4 1/8&#8221; x 2 2/8&#8221; x 7/8&#8221;&#9658; Net Weight:CERTIFICATIONS:CE FCC RoHsCOMPATIBILITY:Apple iPhone 5, 4S, 4, 3, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 1, 2, 3; Nexus; HTC One, Sensations G14 XE XL, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10; LG Optimus; PS Vita, GoPro; Nokia N9 Lumia 920 900 / Blackberry Z10 / Sony Xperia Z; ZTE; T-mobile, VerizonSample provided for review.","overall":5.0,"summary":"The OXA was unexpectedly a solid performer ...","unixReviewTime":1390435200,"reviewTime":"2014-01-23T00:00:00"}

Until I actually work with any battery pack or give them one of my informal tests, I find it hard to pass judgment. Sometimes there are gems in the crowd, similar to books, and the OXA is one of them. Perhaps it has something to do with those Samsung Digital cells.The 7800mAh OXA battery pack really surprised me, but not as much as it could have because after testing the 10000mAh, I knew OXA was a quality brand. The simple LED feature is what most people come to expect, but some are now preferring a digital readout. As long as you make sure you fully charge your battery pack during the night, it&#8217;s not much of a problem.What I found with the 7800mAh OXA, was a battery pack that consistently added a charge to my iPad. I usually use a 1st generation iPad for testing for a decent comparison. The darn thing kept charging long after I figured it would have depleted its charge. I kept pushing it until there wasn&#8217;t any more juice at all. Superb performance and quite unexpected.A single tap on the button on the flat side above the OXA logo will light up the digital display.

With 7800mAh you can fully expect to charge up your phone up a few times or give your tablet a real boost. Overall I was quite satisfied with the performance, something I really didn&#8217;t expect.

Any device that uses a micro USB cord such as a Smartphone, MP 3 player, Kindle, or a digital camera can readily be charged.  I especially like the built-in cable.  No need to carry one along with you ... simply take the charger out of the glove box and you're good to go.Another interesting thing is the fact that the micro USB spring cable, a full six feet in length, can uncoil and be used in the backseat of your vehicle.  It's one of those plug and play type devices that make life so much easier.  It's also very convenient in that you can charge two devices at once.  One built in USB cable, the other you'll have to bring along.The basic specs are on the side of the unit.  The spring clips nicely secured the Steepower Micro USB Car Power Adapter into my lighter socket.  Once inserted into the socket there was about 1 1/2\" sticking out.
