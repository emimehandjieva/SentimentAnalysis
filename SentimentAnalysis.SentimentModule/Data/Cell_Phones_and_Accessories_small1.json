The noise cancellation actually works, which is a major plus. The fit is comfortable for me straight out of the over-designed, way too hip package.Overall, this is one of the best Bluetooth headets I've ever used and I kind of doubt that I will ever want to do without voice command again.From reading Amazon reviews, I've learned that I am far from the only person searching for the \"perfect\" Bluetooth headset. Apparently there are legions of us, wandering the landscape, with drawers filled with the \"next great thing\" Bluetooth headsets that simply didn't make the grade.With the BlueAnt V1, however, I am very pleased. I kind of doubt that I'll be tempted by the next sensation, unless it really is something sensational.Sound quality is my highest priority, primarily because age is taking its toll and I no longer have normal hearing. While I haven't tried the V1 is any place super noisy (because super noisy places aren't in my normal itinerary), I have tried it in environments that have fairly high levels of background noise. The adjustable volume control consists of two well separated buttons, which are easy to find and manipulate. What is cool is that you get positive audio feedback as you adjust the volume with \"audio up\" and \"audio down\" prompts.The noise cancellation technology for transmission seems to work well, though again, I have to stress that I haven't been in any super noisy locations lately. People I've been talking to while testing haven't complained of any degradation in my voice audio.After audio quality, comfort is my next criteria - and the V1 is one of the most comfortable, if not the most comfortable, headsets I've owned. I'm using the stock ear piece and it fits just fine. The ear hook is great, even with my wispy hair. I have no problems wearing the V1 for hours - nor do I have any problem with getting the V1 atached quickly if I've put it in my pocket.Finally the voice command feature: once you use it, you will never want to be without it. The V1 will pair with up to 8 devices concurrently - and pairing is very simple. Once you've paired, when you turn on the V!, it announces you that you are connected, which is so incredibly cool if you've ever been stumped trying to figure out if you were connected to your phone or had another problem. You can ask the V1 to tell you its battery level. You can also use it as a speed dial - and this is one area where BlueAnt made a mistake. They decided what the names of several of the voice dial slots would be - and you can't change them. Likewise, for the ones they didn't name, you have to identify them by their BlueAnt number, i.e., \"Call 6\". Silly move for such an otherwise well thought out and engineered device.Battery life is longer than I'll let it go without recharging. The recharging options are worthy of not. They include a compact AC charger, a flexible gooseneck that can also be used as a USB charging cable and an auto lighter charger as well.Overall, the V1 is definitely well worth the price. Excellent voice quality, noise canceling capability, great design and ergonomics and voice command. It's my favorite Bluetooth headset - and I have an embarrassingly large number of them in my drawers.Jerry", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent in every regard", "unixReviewTime": 1231372800, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2009"}

Voice commands work wonderfully, as does the main control button. Another reviewer's comments about voice dialing are well taken: you have to modify your contacts to correspond to what the Bluetooth wants to hear, e.g., I use \"Voicemail\" for home, my daughter's number for \"favorite\", etc. I made a list and taped it to the inside of my iPhone case, so recall is not a problem. I am still not 100% comfortable with how well the Bluetooth will stay put on my ear.  It did fall off once, so far.  If technical support is important to you (as it should be), you will be happy with the BlueAnt folks. The gentleman who spent at least 10 minutes with me to set the device to go over my left ear (the manual illustrates the right one) never flinched over my clumsiness. Similarly, when I called about the volume problem, they answered promptly and were courteous and knowledgeable.

BUT they sent me a free replacement!Nothing lasts forever, right?  So when the earpiece on my V1 headset began to separate from the body, I was disappointed, but figured I got my money's worth.  So I went ahead and bought a replacement from Amazon cuz I still love this headset -- it's the best I've used, bar none.  But before my replacement even arrived, I remembered BlueAnt offers a 2 year warranty, so I called them up on a whim and explained the problem and they gave me an RA number.  I mailed my broken V1 in and about 1 week later, they sent me a free replacement in full retail packaging!!!  By now, the replacement I ordered form Amazon arrived but I decided to keep both and save one as a spare.  Moral of the story - BlueAnt has awesome customer service and is the V1 is still the best in my book!And now back to my original review...This headset is amazing!! I bought this primarily for the noise and echo canceling feature and I have to say it works like a charm.  I checked out other noise & echo canceling headsets like the Motorola H710 but it looks exactly like my H700 which in my opinion has big design flaws.  Motorola should've done more to upgrade the headset's look and function.  As it is, the 710 is just a boring retread.  But what really sold me on the BlueAnt was the dual microphones.I've done a lot of recording work and know how difficult it can be to eliminate ambient noise, so the concept of dual mics was a revolutionary idea that made total sense to me.  Liken it to having two eyes - you can see everything with just one, but when you look with both eyes, there's more depth, clarity and accuracy with what you're seeing. Well, the same is true with hearing with two ears or a headset with two microphones.  The two mics are the secret to the superior noise & echo canceling of this headset. But don't take my word for it, listen for yourself online.I went to the manufacturer's website and watched a video showing a guy using the BlueAnt headset in action in a noisy bar.  First they just showed the guy talking normally in the bar and you could hear all the ambient noise around him, and that alone was enough to give me a headache (a big reason why I hate places like that.) Then the guy picks up his cell phone and turns on his BlueAnt and they let you hear actual audio from the headset with just normal noise canceling on, and it cut the ambient noise in the bar drastically!  Just on the normal setting! Then the guy turns on max noise canceling and the ambient noise all but disappears!!  No kidding!!  His voice did sound a bit tinnier as a result of all the filtering, but that's to be expected.  You'd never use max canceling in normal situations, just in circumstances where you need to take a call in a noisy location and being heard is paramount.  In any case, the video was quite impressive and a brilliant marketing move.  So I'm wondering if it's just doctored in some way, but the dual mic concept has me sold and the video has me intrigued enough to try it out.  I believe the guy in the video is using a Z9i and supposedly the V1 is even better at noise canceling which is why I chose it.  The two headsets are identical other than color and that the V1 also has voice control.At first, I was wondering if I needed voice control or not.  I also wasn't clear if I could still use my phone's built in voice control with the V1, but the answer turns out to be YES, you can.  You just give the voice command, phone commands, to access your phone's own voice commands.  It's very simple and I like having the option to use either the headset or my phone's voice control.  At first I thought it would be an either or, using one or the other.  As it turns out, I find myself using both for different situations.  And I absolutely love-Love-LOVE that you can ask the headset how much battery life is left!  With no accurate visual indicators on most headsets, like the disappearing battery bars on cell phones that at least give you a clue where you're at, I was always trying to estimate how much I'd used my headset so I could figure out if I needed to recharge it or not.  It's not good to overcharge things so I was always doing the math in my head.  Now, all I have to do is ask, and the little genie in the headset tells me!!  That alone is worth having the V1 over the Z9i in my opinion!So overall, I have to say this is a pretty awesome headset.  When I buy something new, I want it to actually be new, as in, the latest technology.  I always check the item's description to see when it was first available on Amazon and don't buy when I see a product is a year old or more.  Technology is changing everyday, so don't waste your money buying something new that isn't really new since it's been on the market over 12 months.  It's already old, useless junk by then.  The V1 is newly released so it's the latest technology and as a result, won't be obsolete for a while.

With previous headsets of mine, I couldn't turn her up loud enough, and she would hear herself echoing. This headset solves those problems. It's also very comfortable to wear. It comes with multiple ear gels and a clip, but I'm still using the standard pieces.The voice activation is more than a gadget--it enables you to multitask better,whether driving or doing chores around the house.One of the speed dials calls GOOG411, which is an awesome free service.If I could improve it, I would want to be able to customize the voice commands of Call Home, Call Office, Speed Dial 7, etc. I believe I know why they don't...by limiting the number of words used to command the device, it can better recognize what you're saying. They probably had a bunch of varying voices say \"Switch Headset Off\" in order for my voice to work every time. However, if I recorded that phrase myself, I would have to be vary careful to remember the exact speed and pitch I used when speaking the phrase. It's voice recognition work far better than my 3-yr old Motorola Razr.Oh--the two best features!!  You can MUTE it by pressing both vol buttons at the same time.

On more than one occasion in a months time, it stopped recognizing any voice commends (like 'dial voicemail' 'call back' etc). I had to power it off and back on a couple of times to get it to work again.I also thought the caller id announce would be nice, but in practice, it only works if you wear the headset all the time. If you are not wearing it and miss the caller id announce, but put it in your ear as the phone is ringing and press the button to answer the call, it only works about half of the time. I actually missed several calls and had to call people back due to this. Also, I find that I like to just put the headset on when I need to make or receive a call and then take it off. For this, I feel that the Plantronics 925 is a better choice since it's a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it comes with a nice charging case for storage. With the BlueAnt, I always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use.Also, on the BlueAnt, callers said I sounded more muffled than on the Plantronics although they could hear less background noise. In practice, noise cancellation isn't really a big deal because I find that I would rather make a call in a semi-quiet environment anyway. If I'm in my car, I just roll the windows up, no big deal.I ended up returning this headset mainly due to the reliability issue. The fact that my voice didn't sound as good as other Bluetooth headsets was also a deal breaker for me.

Better than any of the MANY other headsets I have - even those costing more! As others mention here, the only drawback is it is harder to fit and keep on your face than the original Jawbone. Unless it touches the cheek bone it doesn't work well at all (hence the name Jawbone). I found that if I throw out the earloops and earbuds it came with and replace them with the eargels designed for the Plantronics 925, it becomes the perfect headset! I will upload a picture. They are $5 on the Plantronics site for a 3-pack. Aliph should just toss these in with the Jawbone and all the complaints are removed.I also own the original Jawbone, so my thoughts are mostly a comparison between the two. For the most part, the Jawbone II makes the almost perfect original Jawbone headset almost \"perfecter\". No wireless headset cancels background noise better. Those of you that don't use a jawbone - you have no idea how annoying it is to talk to you with all the noise around you... The jawbone should be required so other people can hear you!In terms of sound, the new model handles wind better, so it's better outside (although not in a high wind or with the convertible top down...)The best part of the new Jawbone II is how light and small it is. The original was just a bit bulky and heavy, so my ear would get sore after a long call. It also had a very hard to use ear loop system.The other major improvement is the charging connector. The original Jawbone cable is hard to detach and you feel like you are going to break something when disconnecting it. The new one is heald by a magnate like an Apple laptop. Very nice touchThat's where the big improvement is for the JB-II. It's so light you forget you have it on. The simplified earloop is much better, as well. Unfortunately they don't include extras so be careful when bending it to make adjustments! If you break the earloop, you are out of luck until you can order more...What I don't like: The main button is too easy to push and goes from edge to edge. Every time I try to adjust it while on a call, I hang the phone up person I'm talking to. That drives me crazy, especially since it's so light that it is harder to keep snugly in place.And that's my other complaint. The new earloop and speaker buds don't hold it on my head as well. If it comes loose, I hang up the call if I try to adjust it. Once I finally got it to fit, I still found the need to adjust it during calls and then hanging up when I touched it. Note: This problem is solved by switching to the Plantronics 925 ear gels. Now I don't have to touch it.I've even gone to using the earloops from my original jawbone, which helped some but they are not comfortable. I finally got the JB-II loops to fit reasonably well, I've really enjoyed using it. Note: now that I've started using the eargels as mentioned above, there is no need to use the earloops - problem solved...Other than holding it on my face and the button being too sensitive, this thing is amazing and I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best by far, Keeping it on my face now solved!", "unixReviewTime": 1225756800, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2008"}

The Noise Assassin works as advertised (as long as you make sure the little white button is pressed against your face), it is super light weight, it looks decent on (there's no huge bling light attracting attention), and there is a great volume range to work with.I only have a few complaints. The on / off switch is part of the body. If you happen to put this device in a soft case, there's a good chance it will turn on. If there's no bluetooth device to pair with, it turns itself off after a certain amount of time. But if it pairs, well, it will be on when you might not intend it to be on.I haven't used it for a great length of time, but you really have to select the right sized ear bud. It's not quite what you would think. With in ear headphones, you look for a tight in ear canal fit. With this device, you need to look for a tight outer ear fit (not in the ear canal but that big flat area just outside the canal opening).If you push the ear bud into your ear canal, you won't be able to hear outside sounds through that ear. A very strange feeling to say the least.The comments about it being hard to put on without turning it off or on, or changing the volume. All hooey. It's very simple to just hold this headset by the edges and you can put it on easily and quickly without changing a setting.

After breaking several ear hooks, and trying several combinations of the included ear buds and after market ones, I was finally able to get an \"ok\" fit.  The original jawbone suffered from a lack of incoming sound as well as a problem with the charger, after several charges, of snapping off the end of the jawbone connector, exposing part of the circuitry. The original jawbone was rather large, but, it did work as advertised.Now with the new jawbone, Aliph must have been listening to the feedback/complaints from their users.  The easily to break ear hooks have been replaced.  They have a pseudo leather wrap, for those that don't wear glasses, and a bare version for those who the larger diameter hooks may interfere with their glasses. The ear buds have also been redesigned.The old ones had a 1/2 twist to lock them on and off the headset, which,after several tries/attempts to get a good fit, would either break, or fall off.  The new ear buds are much softer and simply pop on and off the headset. The charger has been improved.  It now works similar to the chargers for the Apple line of notebooks. There are two small magnets on either side of the four pins for the charger. You place the charger close to the new jawbone and it will snap into place, and the red charge lightwill come on, verifying that the connection is made. Charge time has been improved, to 45 minutes on a dead battery.  On the downside, the talk/standby time was reduced, most likely, do to the smaller size.On a personal note, I preferred the original jawbone buttons,which had a slight raised feel, for the connect/disconnect. The new one,once you find the sweet spot is ok, but the raised one was better.The way you activate voice dialing is different.  On the old jawbone, youhit the connect/disconnect button.  On the new one, you press the noise assassin button.  This also doubles as the volume button during a call.the locations for the microphones have changed. Depending on if you wear the headset on the left or right side, the microphones are on the top or bottom of the headset, which, will aid in reducing wind noise, and the wind won't be as prone to blow directly into the microphone. Size & weight are reduced as well.Out of the box, after charging, the first time you turn it on, it is automatically in pairing mode, so, you will need to have your phone indiscovery mode before you turn it on.As for sound, everyone says the outgoing sound is a little better, but, the outgoing sound, according to my friends, was good to start with.Noise reduction has apparently been tweaked, as friends say they \"hear less\" background noise, but as with the outgoing sound, there wasn't much ougoing noise to start with.  As with my old jawbone, since I work in a noisy environment some times, I turned the noise assassin off starting my tests, in a shop, with several LOUD mouthed people yacking away, then turned the noise assassin on, and the background noise disappeared.I then turned a vacuum on and the other party could not hear the vacuum,until I turned the noise assassin off.I use an aftermarket jetsound custom ear piece, because I wear my headset8-10 hours a day, therefore I cannot speak about the durability of the ear hooks, but they appear to be MUCH improved over the original jawbone.All in all, I think Aliph did a great job improving what was alreadyone of the best noise canceling headsets out there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better fit, lighter, louder than the original", "unixReviewTime": 1213056000, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2008"}

If the answer is \"yes\" then buy this and don't look back. If you don't care about those sorts of things, then there are probably easier-to-use units out there.This is my second Jawbone; I used the original Jawbone for just over a year when it broke (turns out the warranty is only a year long!). I was actually kind of glad to get a new one because I wanted to check out the Jawbone 2. Well, the Jawbone 2 is smaller and, I think, easier to fit. It also makes more intuitive noises--the tones make it much clearer if you're turning it on or off. But the Jawbone 1 had certain things going for it that I miss. Most importantly, I like using voice dialing. With the Jawbone 1, you could just press the primary button to access voice dialing. With this one, you have to press the Noise Assassin button, which I've given up on finding. Even if I could find it, you would have to hold it down for two seconds, which is a lot less convenient than a single push. As far as I can tell the only reason why this change was made was to allow one to turn off the flashing light display by pressing the primary button five times in succession--a much less functional use for that button. Maybe the Jawbone 3 will fix this someday.With each of my Jawbones, I left myself a voicemail while driving at freeway speed to gauge the quality of the noise reduction. The original Jawbone was good, but this one is better. At 80mph I was speaking in a normal tone and I even cranked the music so loud at one point that I couldn't hear myself talk. When I picked up the voicemail, I couldn't believe it--my voice was coming through perfectly understandably as if I was speaking in the quietest room of the house. The part with the music had only the very slightest bit of noise to it. In short, the noise reduction on this thing is incredible. I'm also pleased to report that the major annoyance with the original Jawbone has been fixed: you can actually turn up the volume loud enough to hear the person you're talking to! (The original jawbone is known for not putting out much volume.)Some reviewers are complaining about the sound quality and sounding like they're underwater. They probably don't have the little plastic nub touching their face. This is critical for the Jawbone to figure out what you are saying versus outside noise. If it's not touching your face then the unit will cancel out your voice.I disagree with other reviewers that the primary button is too easy to press when adjusting this unit to your ear. I like its sensitivity, and it's very easy to get used to handling it by the edges to avoid this issue.

It just proves that we are all looking for something different, and what works for one person may not work for the next.  I, personally, love this headset.  It is compact, unobtrusive, easy to wear, easy to use, and it fits me beautifully.I am lucky enough to be able to telecommute from home full time, and I spend fully 8 hours a day on the phone.  Over the past 5 years, I have tried many different headsets, both wired and Bluetooth.  With some, the earbuds were too big, hurt my ears, and gave me a perpetual headache.  Others didn't stay on, fell out, and were easily lost.  Some just weren't hardy enough.  My young daughter, as a toddler, found them easy to pry apart and rip out the internal wiring.  (I lost two Jabras that way...sigh.)  And with wired headsets, the wires just plain get in the way, or they get tangled, or they (again) are too tempting for little fingers.The JAWBONE II stays in my ear, no problem.  It comes with three earbud sizes and three earloop sizes.  The smallest bud and the medium loop make the fit perfect for me.  I tested the fit by jumping up and down, shaking my head around, and doing cartwheels (yes, cartwheels).  The headset stays in.  It is light weight and comfortable; I almost forget that it is there.  I have not had any trouble learning to use the hidden buttons; after all, I watched Lt. Uhura do it for years on Star Trek.  Hold the button for a few seconds to turn the unit on or off, tap it once to answer or hang up calls.The sound quality is great; I can hear everyone and everyone can hear me.  There IS a trick; however.  You have to make sure that the voice activity sensor, which activates the NoiseAssassin, is touching your cheek near your jaw.  This simple trick ensures that you are heard clearly.  For me, I just make certain that the JAWBONE is parallel to the floor and is in contact with my cheek.  It seems to work every time.  I am heard clearly, with no ambient noise.The JAWBONE BLUETOOTH HEADSET WITH NOISEASSASSIN-JAWBONE II (BLACK) is small, sleek, and black; it is practically hidden beneath my hair, but looks very professional when seen.

I was even more delighted to find that, even with the hook removed, it still fits great and is sufficiently secure, with the required speech sensor nub making good contact.  It's very light, and I can leave it in my ear for extended lengths of time with little discomfort.I have to atribute the \"the fit is awful!\" comments to the fact that everyone's ears are shaped different.  But I'm pleased that it fits me well.Sound Quality 8/10: I did extensive testing (by calling another phone's voicemail) of the Jawbone II and my other candidate, the Plantronics 925.  In general use (indoors, or driving on the highway), the sound quality of the Plantronics was noticeably better... speech was \"crisper\" and more defined, while the Jawbone II (as well as the Blueant Z9 that I also tested) had a slightly muffled tone.  I attribute this to the fact that the Plantronics \"boom\" mic is positioned closer to the mouth.However, in a more \"extreme\" test (windows rolled down, radio on, etc.), the Jawbone II clearly was superior at isolating my voice and minimizing background noise.  Even when I could barely hear myself talking, on playback, my voice was legible (though not perfectly, and some background noise does come through), while the Plantronics let a considerably higher amount of background noise through.Design & UI 6/10: As has been mentioned before, it's FAR too easy to press the button on the Jawbone II.  In other words, a client who you've been waiting for days to call you back finally calls, and as you're talking, you adjust the headset's position in your ear... poof, you've just hung up on then.  Gripping the sides of the unit near the earbud usually results in the same thing.The best way to adjust it is to grip it on the sides, but lower (closer to the speech sensor nub).  It's a little more awkward to adjust it like this, but it's better than hanging up on your caller.In the end, I decided to keep the Jawbone II, but it was a very close contest between it and the Plantronics 925.  The fit was good on both, though the Jawbone II is less conspicuous.

After talking to people I saw wearing a jawbone and reading reviews from numerous sources, I took the plunge with the JB2.  It has been the best headset I have owned, better than several wired headsets even.  The sound quality is great, which has been one of my biggest complaints over the years (the loudest setting hurts my ear in a quiet room).  I have tested it in several noisy environments, including a speeding car with the windows down, noisy mall, sitting next to a car blaring rap music.  The best test was as I talked on the headset and turned up the car stereo gradually.  The other party couldn't even hear the music until it got so loud in the car that I couldn't have even held a normal conversation with a live passenger sitting next to me. So, i am impressed wit the performance of the JB2.A couple of drawbacks that others have noticed related to fit.  It does have a weird way in which it sits in your ear.  The rubber earpiece pushes in your ear and you have to get the right size earpiece snapped on to make it work well (it comes with 3 little earpieces)  I have to jam it fairly hard to make it fit right, but it isn't uncomfortable once it's in.  You also have to get the right fit on the ear loop for it to stay on well (it comes with several loops as well).  It's light enough that you don't really notice it hanging once it's in and once you get it fitted correctly and used to it, it's very comfortable (I've had other headsets that got heavy after a while or the loop pulled on my ear).  So, while it took a few tries to get the fit right, I think that some people complaining about it, might not have taken the time to really work with the fitting options.Also, some people complain about the controls.  Once you know how they work, you shouldn't have too much of a problem.  Yes, they could be positioned or marked better, but this thing is almost a work or art, without and logos or writing on it, and the actually sound and voice quality makes this a non-issue for me.I have no idea how the new JB3 can top this one, but it must be spectacular if it really is a huge step up from the JB2!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best BT headset I have owned - but take the time to fit it properly", "unixReviewTime": 1253836800, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2009"}

So far, the pluses:1. noise cancellation does work well - caller from the receiving end commented that I was in the office but in reality I was driving in my car2. wind noise resistant - pretty good, just make my voice a bit muffledThe minuses:1. The fit is not so good and even with the ear loop, voice quality depended heavily on how and where you position the jawbone II2. Battery life (active not standby) seemed shorter than stated (4 hrs) - your mileage may vary but I got about 2 hours talk time out of it3.

Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made.Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this. In order to switch ears, you have to remove the earloop and reinstall it.While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled, soft and digital-like.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer, it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal, but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph.A much better choice would be theBlueAnt  Z9i Bluetooth Headset (Black)because:-It doesn't require the unit to be touching your jaw bone or cheek at all-It's a lot easier to put on and take off-It's more comfortable and doesn't fall off as easily-It' has two selectable levels of noise cancellation-It's firmware update-able-It has wind noise suppression-It's cheaper yet audio quality both to callers and to you are about the same.

I saw this in the Apple store, asked about it, thought about it, read about it, then went ahead and bought it.  It's insurance, right?  Do you ever get your insurance money back?In this case, Lord, I hope not.  It was money well INVESTED.Think of all the other things you buy insurance for, car, home, boat, motorcycle.  We buy covers for our barbeque grills and netting to deer-proof azaleas, and this is cheap by comparison.I have to say I'm pretty facile when it comes to using things like this; it wasn't much of a problem to clean the screen in a relatively dust-free area of the house.  We own: two HUGE german shepherd dogs, a shiba inu, an umbrella cockatoo, four finches and a green-cheek conure, two large bearded dragons who also shed perpetually, and there are two adults and two teens in the house.  We could open a store called \"Dust is Us,\" and clean up... ahem.  This was also the peak of grass pollen season.I was really surprised and relieved that I didn't get a single speck of lint/dust/hair under the film after I put it on, peeled it off to reposition, put it on, peeled it off to reposition and get the air bubbles out.  On and off three times.  I THINK the trick (if I had it to do all over again) is to start with the LONG side of the screen then work across.  Forget about getting the button hole centered.PROS:- cheap insurance.  works.  I have a \"Shield\" back cover (the semi-sticky kind) and with the film I can just put the phone in my front pocket and pull it out when I need it.  Occasionally I've put my keys in the same pocket and if the iPhone screen COULD have been scratched, it would have been.  But I have the film.- easier to apply than it sounds or others have suggested.  It's not chewing gum, doing tensor calculus and riding a skateboard on a humpback whale during breeching season, but it's a little harder than, say, hitting the snooze button on your clock.- it really sticks, and without anything sticky.  See CONS below.CONS:IF you use postits for shopping lists (or a day planner.  just ask me), and you put it in the same pocket as your iPhone, DON'T!  The reason post-its are so popular, the reason they work so well, is that the adhesive doesn't work that well.  Believe me, it does.  It sticks to this film like love-bugs on a radiator in summer. (oblique living in hell - um, Florida - reference there, no offense meant).  The post-it comes off, the adhesive stays.  It's a real bear to remove, too.  IF you use a strip of cellophane tape (scotch or box), the film comes right off the screen first.  Again, I pressed it down and then peeled off the tape and postit residue obliquely in the same plane as the film.  worked fine.  And again, no dust under the screen.LESSONS LEARNED:a 1/2 inch piece of tape will effectively peel back the film without damaging it if you need to get that speck of dust out from under the film.  But make sure your house is full of dog, bird and lizard dander and dust mites and pollen before even trying to apply this, or you might get a single speck somewhere that'll bug the heck out of you for years (or the next generation comes along).This is a good product, and cheaper here (no tax or shipping, either) than at the Apple Store.

They look just as they did when they came out of the box from the AT&T; store.It allows easy access to the entire screen, there's just enough of an edge on the front to protect it on a face-first drop, but doesn't have the obnoxious 'over cover' on the bottom and top of the front like some other cases, and easy access to all buttons (while also being protected from drops) plus you can dock it if you have one.It is a simple, elegant design that just works.I personally don't like flip cases - just get in the way. I use it too much to have to keep flipping and holding open. Also, I didn't use the included film. I prefer the stick-on kind (takes a few extra minutes, but you don't have to worry about dust, moving around and scratching the screen, etc.)I suspect that I will wear this out eventually so have an extra on hand should Griffin decided (for some strange reason) to quit making these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best phone case I have owned across all phones", "unixReviewTime": 1220745600, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2008"}

I might go higher after I spend time with it. I have been thru MANY iphone cases trying to find the best one. I think I was a little obsessive about it.Avoid all the silicone / rubber cases, they look nice, they grip well but they ALL stretch some over time. What starts our as a snug glove - tight fit loosens a lot until it squishes around the unit like its made 1 size too big. The hard shell case is the way to go. they don't stretch. Try to get one with a \"grippy\" surface as opposed to the slick ones that make the iphone prone to flying out of your hand.The Pros - fits perfectly, bottom locks into the top and you have one seamless fit. It says you can take the bottom off to dock but I bet this will fit in my Sony clock radio just fine as ia. Nice grip-able leather surface & feels good to hold. The sides are just shallow enough to not get in the way of your fingers as you type but enough that if you turn it face down the glass won't be touching the surface. The cut outs for the top and side buttons is well done, your fingers find the buttons easily without looking.The Cons: Just the weird poly-carbonate shield it ships with. It might turn out to be awesome but I am used to the very clingy type of stick-on shield. This one is much thicker and you can take it off and re-apply. There's a lot of glare caused by this new shield and it seems to attract prints more. I guess the upside is I can take it off and wash it and put it back on. I will say tho, while looking at the iphone straight on I can't really see any difference. Its mainly when looking at it from the side or when its off. Anyways, I can easily buy some regular press on screens if I don't like this one but I like the idea of thicker and re-useable.Its also a little tricky when you slide the bottom on to make sure the screen cover and such are all in the right grooves, its that reason I'd prefer to not take the bottom off any more than I have to.So, wow - maybe my search for the perfect case is over.

The rubberized case is huge, but provides fantastic protection to the iPhone 3GS against drops. I absolutely love that they have finally made a way to flip the bottom of the case back so you can place the phone in the dock. For expensive items like iPods, iPhones, etc., I *always* use a protective case, and none of the cases I have had ever allowed using a dock. This one does.The clip (removable) also serves as a stand for viewing vertical or horizontal stuff (like movies!). GREAT!The removable clip/holster evolves a bit from past incarnations, and has two protruding \"wings\" on the side I really do not like, and I am not sure what they are for. The only guess I have is that if you drop it IN the case, and it lands screen down, those protrusions protect it from hitting the screen. That might be worthwhile.The back of the clip has a clamp that swivels/rotates, AND it pops up -- I have snagged it a few times and instead of breaking the clip, it popped off -- that's much better than needing to replace the clip (like I have had to do on my Blackberry case three times so far).The one thing I did not like was how the swivel clip is not centered like on past models -- so if you put the clip upside down (so you have access to the dock connector for charging) it sets up differently (different angle) than if you have it the other way. It still lets you put it on the side for watching movies.

Toughskin gives you pretty good confidence that your expensive toy is going to be protected, and the design is comfortable and easy to grip.The only downsides worth mentioning is that the belt clip is nice enough, but off-center in a horizontal orientation, and the case is the bulkiest I've seen. Of course, the bulk is sort of the point, since it gives better protection than other cases, but be aware of the size if you like a smaller style. Also, the design of the case makes it difficult to reach the silence switch, use the home button, and touch the edges of the screen because the case sticks out so much. You get used to it, though.Lastly, while this case provides the best-seeming drop protection of any case I've seen, it does nothing about scratch protection for your screen, so make sure you pick up ascreen protector, too.In summary, I think this is one of the best iPhone 3G/3GS cases out there.

The Candyshell was not perfect for the boy who quickly snapped the thin bottom rail on the case which is a common weak spot on the Candyshell. The Toughskin is perfect for him.

I've been using this case for about 2 months now and I originally made the decision to purchase it based on several factors. I wanted a case that was going to offer as much coverage as possible. There doesn't seem to be another iPhone case on the market that does the job quite as well as the Pixel Skin. Having kids and pets and just general craziness on a daily basis, I hugely appreciate that all of the buttons on the phone are completely covered yet still very accessible. I even feel that the buttons are easier to push with this case in place as you don't have to push as hard to get a response. It was very important to me that the buttons be protected from gunk build up from little hands, being in pockets, etc and I'm very pleased that this gives me that security 100%. This is the only case I've seen (excluding the very expensive Otterbox) that covers the home button. Love it! I have dropped my phone twice and it is just fine, in large part due to this case, I'm sure. It has a very nice tactile grip and I can comfortably hold it in one hand and text, access calendar, shopping list, etc without fear of it slipping out of my hand.And now the cons. I have a kind of love/hate relationship with the texture. While it is soft and grippy and durable, it is also a total lint magnet, but the great thing about that is the case is extremely easy to remove and a quick rinse in the sink (and thorough dry after, of course!) is enough to get it clean again. But be prepared, if it's kept in a pocket a lot and especially if you have pets, it will attract lots of little bits of yuck. It also can be a bit of a nuisance to pull out of a pocket, especially if you wear more fitted pants like I do. The good side to that, however, is that it is less likely to fall out of your pocket! So, like I said, it's a love/hate thing. ;) The only other minor issue I have with this case is it's bulk. It does add significant bulk to the case but it is justified. You are getting much more shock absorption from this case than you would with a hard slim line case. So while it's not the prettiest case in the world, in my opinion, it is definitely some of the best protection for your iPhone available, and at a great price to boot.If you're going for pure looks, want less bulk and aren't as concerned about drops/kids/pets, you would probably be happier with a slider case such as the ones from Casemate.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great protection", "unixReviewTime": 1269043200, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2010"}

DO NOT attempt to use with a car charger, wall charger, etc. unless you confirm that it puts out ONLY 500 mA, and no more.  See [UPDATE] section below, for more details. ***[Capacity summary: was able to (carefully!) charge my Droid X **which has an extended internal battery with 20% more capacity** 1.3 times.  If product worked as advertised, I should have been able to charge at least 2.3 times, assuming my Li-ion phone battery is at the poor end of the charging-efficiency spectrum.  Would expect at least 2.7 charges for Droid X with regular (non-extended) internal battery.]Overall design is very nice; it looks very nice, shape is good, very attractive.  But... several problems.First, this battery was supposed to be in 'new' condition, but was very clearly (and heavily) pre-used; the box had stains, sticky stuff, and extra circular stickers on it (from where the previous 'owner' broke the seal).Second, it didn't work.  My phone (Droid X with genuine Motorola extended battery BH6X, which holds 1800 mAh instead of the usual 1500) could only charge from it a total of about 1.3 times, before the external battery was totally drained.  I was surprised, so I repeated the test, and got the same results.  I was super careful: I let the external battery charge for 36 hours; I waited til my phone was down to 30%; then I charged it up to 100% (cell was on; gps/wireless off; all tasks killed; screen off/no activity).  I then disconnected the external battery right away, when the phone reached 100%.I then repeated the process; I plugged the phone into the external battery at 30%.  About two hours later, it was at 70%, but the external battery was 100% drained.Very disappointing performance.  It was only able to transfer 45% of its alleged  energy to the Droid X (1800 x 1.3 = 2340 mAh, out of 5200), but Wikipedia says that Li ion should be able to charge at 80-90% efficiency -- so something is clearly wrong here.I would stay away; I was worried when I bought it, noticing that many recent reviews (as of April 2011) had complained of the same.  I think they're selling a bunch of their returned units.  This really irks me, as I'm extremely busy, and really don't have time for this kind of stuff; I want to just buy a product that works and lasts, and I'm happy to pay whatever it takes.[UPDATE]Satechi contacted me.  They claim that smart phone chargers provide too many amps, and that this fries the external battery.  They recommend *only* charging from a laptop (where the USB is limited to 0.5A), whereas I used (in my two tests) chargers with 850 and 1000 amps.However, this is no excuse; this is a design defect.  You should be able to charge from any source, as long as it has at least 500 mA.  Every other electronics device on the planet has circuitry to limit the amperage it takes in to what it needs, and gracefully rejects excess current.  They tried very hard over the phone to convince me that this was not a design defect; I found this very disingenuous.

It fit both of us very nicely, and we both have freakishly small ears.2. Pairing with the phone (iPhone) was easy, but I'm beginning to think that pairing is very seldom an issue with bluetooth headsets.3. The sound quality (speaker on the headset) was good.THE BAD:1. The only really bad thing, and ultimately the reason we returned it, is that the person on the other end had difficulty understanding what you were saying. My wife (the one using the Samsung WEP 301) always sounded very distant, tinny, and staticy. I thought it may be because I was listening to her on my bluetooth device (plantronics discovery 925), but other people had the same complaint. I frequently was having to ask her to repeat herself. WE got tired of this, so we returned it and bought a Jabra 4010.As far as comparison to a similarly priced headset, the Jabra 4010 is much better, in my opinion. While it doesn't fit as deeply in the ear as the Samsung, the sound quality on both ends is great. When my wife is using it, I can't tell a difference between her using the headset and her using the phone.If you had to choose between the two devices, I'd go with the Jabra 4010 easily...even if it is more expensive (which we paid the same price for both of them).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for (too cliche?)", "unixReviewTime": 1241568000, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2009"}

I really disagree.  This is one of the easiest screen protectors to apply and I've tried MANY brands.  I've spent over $100 on different screen protectors of all types, mirror, glossy, privacy, and just regular like this one.  Zagg was the one I first ever bought, and I decided to stray away because I wanted something cool like the privacy, then the mirror, then so on and so on.  I've come back to Zagg twice on one device (and used it on three different devices (iPhone, another iPhone, and iPod Touch)).  Point is, I can't find anything better.It's actually really easy, especially if you follow the directions.  It's a lot easier to get Zagg on the screen and eliminate bubbles than any other because the screen protector is soft.  It's not a stiff piece of material.  You don't need steady hands because if you put plenty of the spray supplied on your fingers (prevent fingerprints very well this way) and on your screen (but not to drown your phone) and on the sticky part of the screen protector, you should be able to place it on the screen and basically slide it around until it's in the right position you want it.  The key is using the spray plentifully (it won't damage your phone unless you basically pour the whole thing on it).I've done this so many times and each time it takes me less than 10 minutes to get it on perfect, no air bubbles not lint underneath, it's just great.  Other screen protectors I always catch lint under it and get awful bubbles and have to redo it for about 30 minutes at a time.  The squeegee is actually a squeegee it's not a piece of plastic like others provide so it actually pushes the solution out properly and gets all the bubbles out.  So it's really good quality.I really recommend getting this for iPhone because at one time I had it for over a year before I decided to get another screen protector just because I wanted to try something new, not because it was peeling off or anything.  It was still in tact and looked brand new.One thing I would not recommend though is the Zagg full body shield.  It's really bad honestly.  I could never get it on without having bubbles or misaligned because the iPhone 3G has curves which make it hard to make it stick on.  It eventually sticks on after 23 hours (around the corners) but after about 6-10 months the little edges start to peel off and you get really noticeable dirt build up on all edges and underneath the little \"arms\" that wrap around the corners.  So I did not like that I had to get a replacement for that (which is free with a $4 shipping charge but still it should've lasted much longer than that).  But the front screen protector, I've never had a problem with so I'd highly recommend it.  Don't be scared of the other reviews, just watch the installation guide videos and use plenty of spray and you'll be fine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I'd recommend", "unixReviewTime": 1269475200, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2010"}

The reason to buy this one is that it is made specifically for the PS3 and it provides certain features that the 'other' sets don't. When properly paired with the PS3 (using the USB wire, NOT the standard Bluetooth pairing process) you will be able to see your set's status such as 'battery charge' or mute on/off on-screen. There is also a voice command mode that would allow certain games to better interpret your voice commands.To summarize the positives:- integrates with the PS3 better than other sets- may be better at helping the PS3 recognize your voice commands (haven't tested this myself yet)- good, convenient placement for the 'mute' button- good color coordination with your PS3 and your other PS3 peripherals- works with any Bluetooth capable phone- my kids think it's coolOn the negative side:- relatively expensive- not the best design in the world- not very good fit for MY ear (most headsets do not fit well in my ear)Overall, the negatives are not such a big deal.

I couldn't have been more wrong.As headsets go, I have worn a LOT of them.  I've owned old-fashioned wired headsets, pre-bluetooth wireless that communicated with a little receiver you clipped to your belt and plugged into your phone, and of course... plenty of bluetooth sets.Let me start by saying that you do NOT need this headset for a PlayStation3.  In theory, ANY bluetooth headset will work with a PS3.  (Granted some won't because bluetooth is inherently buggy technology.)  Likewise, this headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone.  However, my personal preference is to have separate headsets because I don't like pairing and unpairing all the time.Having said that, let's talk about this headset.  It is about as basic as basic gets.  If all you need is basic, more power to you, but you'll find similar quality for less money with other sets. Try theJabra BT4010, which as of this writing sells for half the price of the Sony.  Heck, you can even find $10 bluetooth headsets if you really want to go cheap!Apart from poor value, the Sony set is an awkward fit.  It has only a thin rubber ring around a little plastic \"barrel\" that is supposed to stay fastened in your ear.  Most other sets either have a \"form-fitted\" rubber piece or simply stay out of your ear altogether.  This design gets uncomfortable quickly because A) the part that goes in your ear may not be the right size for your ear and B) the over-the-ear loop is made of cheap plastic as opposed to being rubber or having a rubber coating like many other sets.The battery life is decent, but nothing to write home about.  And the charging stand? It's cheap, very lightweight plastic that falls over very easily.  If the USB cable is a little bit stiff, the natural tendency for it to curl may very well topple the stand.As for sound quality... yeah, basic again.  Sure, it works, but once again it is very basic.  I felt like it didn't have a very good range of volume.  Many times I had it cranked to the max and still could barely hear.Since games are usually $60 and this headset came bundled inside a $60 game, I tried hard to find a reason to keep it, after all wasn't it \"free\"?  In the end, I could find no redeeming qualities and returned it rather than allowing it to take up space in a drawer somewhere.If you'd like some good places to start your search for another headset, here are a few:Personally, I just can't get over theJabra FreeSpeak BT250V.  It's so comfortable I don't even notice it's there and it also has a vibrating/call notification feature, which is absolutely great for leaving your phone on the charger and keeping the headset with you at home or office.  As of this writing, the Sony is ~$45 and the Jabra is ~$60.  You may find the Jabra cheaper but even at $60 it's DEFINITELY a better value than the Sony!If you're looking for a really great sounding bluetooth set (i.e. for listening to music), I've been really happy with theMotorola HT820.  It has two speakers and wraps around the back of your head/neck.  Fair warning, though- the Motorola sounds awesome but the speakers are huge and wearing this set makes you look like a total dork.There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of bluetooth headsets out there so no matter which one you finally choose, please just don't make it this Sony piece of junk.  Your dollars will go farther on something with the same quality/lower price, or same price/higher quality.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "You can find better", "unixReviewTime": 1253145600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2009"}

I did find a solution to this if you just don't jam in into your ear canal that far into your ear it is very comfortable and functional.

Because frankly, I'm too scared to change! Really though, I have a $29 a month plan (Business 300) that is no longer offered - 300 whenever, unlimited weekends, 100 texts, which has worked well for my needs and budget.  Unfortunately all the handsets I've owned (Nokia and Motorola) have had terrible reception much of the time.  I was blaming T-Mobile until I got the Nokia E71 and I'm THRILLED with the call clarity! Both on my end and for the recipients of my calls, who say they can't tell I'm on my cell - 'a first'.I purchased this item as a Gold Box deal after reading online reviews here and elsewhere, that gave it mostly glowing reviews.  I also liked that it would work on T-Mobile or ATT, which are both available in my area.  I had hopes of using T-Mobile's $10 a month add-on for 'unlimited web for phones' (previously called Web2Go.Upon opening the box I was surprised to see that the size and thickness of the phone are almost identical to my iPod Touch.  Very pretty - sexy even - the phone has an easy to use keyboard (my first phone with this type) with raised keys.  I have small hands and didn't find it tough to punch in numbers or texts, but people with bigger fingers might. The keyboard is backlit, which is very helpful, but it's not very bright.  I bet there's a setting for that which I've not yet discovered though.The documentation, a CD for the PC Sync suite from Nokia, an AC charger, earphone/microphone combo, white (slip-in style) case, battery, and phone are in the box. I also bought aOtterBox Commuter Case for Nokia E71x (Black)to protect it.  This case takes away from the beauty of the phone, but gives a bit of added protection.  The Otterbox Defender series is even better, but more expensive.Not being a big reader of directions, I tried to wade through the manuals anyway.  That was daunting.  There is a lot of info on this phone as it has a lot of functions! I found that after I swapped my SIM card from my previous T-Mobile phone and got to the home screen on the E71, I could press 'menu' and then 'help', and again 'help', to be where I wanted to be to learn about this device.Some cool functions found on this phone and discussed in 'help':-Adobe Reader-Activation Keys-Active Notes-Barcode Reader... VERY unusual to find on a phone and very cool to save product info and compare prices.-Dictionary-Flash Player-GPS-Internet Radio-Modem - you can connect this phone (assuming you have mobile web on it activated) to a laptop for example, and use it as a wireless modem.-Net calls... it has a webcam built in.-Printing... add a printer to sync with your device to print docs.-Real Player-Recorder-Wireless keyboard...if you link it to your phone, you can use it!A 'Tutorial' section is a available in the 'Help' section as well, with short animated videos on 'how-to'.  I like this area, but even with these helps... this phone has a lot to offer and a lot to learn.The E71's build quality is excellent!  Metal housing makes a world of difference in the feel of the phone.  I expect it would add to the durability as well.  My Nokia 5300 with a hard case started cracking within months of light use, as have other plastic phones I've owned, so for me, this is a big deal.Navigating the phones many functions is relatively easy, but yes, it takes time to get the hang of it.  Buttons for specific functions like email, 'home' and others are clearly marked.  The side of the phone has a mini-usb port and mini-SD card slot, covered by rubber inserts. Volume controls are on the opposite side of the phone and work easily and well.The 3.2mp camera is better than previous phones I've owned and it does come with a flash, which is new to me on a camera phone. Images were blurry or 'cloudy' looking, until one reader of the review mentioned taking the plastic film off the lens. \"Duh!\"  Usually I remember these things, but not this time.  Taking the film off the camera lens definitely makes for better pictures - clarity wise - however the color of the images taken indoors with the flash, tends to be a bit off. Not a huge deal as photo editing software takes care of a multitude of sins, but you probably wouldn't want this camera to be your only one.Charging port is at the base of the phone, with the speaker and on/off at the top.  I noted the microphone is at the lower left-hand side of the phone.  This is great if you are right handed while making calls, but call quality seems to suffer just a bit when you switch to left-handed chats.  Microphone placement... who knew?!The keypad does lock and the screen goes dark rather quickly.  Again, probably just a setting issue I've not yet discovered in my 3 days playing with it. I looked it up in the book how to 'unlock' - pressing two buttons - which while a pain, is no big deal either.The screen is big enough for most things.  Not fantastic for viewing web content, but this isn't really a web-maximized phone either.  The OS alone should tell you that, and if you're looking for a multi-media phone, keep looking.  It will email, do basic web browsing, and open media files if you have the appropriate data plan.  I didn't want to pay for the $20-30 a month web plan, so I am trying out the $10 a month unlimited web plan for phones with TM right now.  While I have a very basic Facebook interface for example, it's nothing like you would see on your home computer.  It is however, handy to Google things, comparison shop while out and about, check weather, etc..., which is good enough for me.  **I have been told by some that T-Mobile may try and kick me off this $10 plan saying if I have a smartphone I need the more expensive one.  My time with T-Mobile would be cut short if this happens, and I'd be looking to switch to ATT, as for me, this would be simply a way for more cash without 3G!  T-Mobile does not have 3G to this phone, but the phone IS capable of it.I was going to return this phone, but that was due more to T-Mobile issues rather than the phone. I love the clear call quality most of all and the easy texting. Admittedly, basic stuff. The internet, if available, also affords some nice things like email, Skype chat, Facebook, and Internet radio (too bad it's got that 2.5mm port versus the 3.5mm standard).In conclusion, it's a really nice phone for the right user. Not the best for multi-media or taking pictures, but a quad-band phone that has exceptionally good call quality, nice speaker and keyboard, moves quickly through apps, has built-in GPS (no internet needed) and Wifi capable.  I really like it, which I can't say about many phones I've owned. So the only real problems I find with it are linked more to T-Mobile as a provider than the phone itself. Which leads me to the basic question: 'Is the money I paid for it even on sale, worth it?'  \"Probably... at least for me.\"4/26/10:I have had a full 24 hrs of using this phone with T-Mobile's 'unlimited web for phones' ($10 a month) add on. I lost it initially when T-Mobile figured out I'd switched phones.  I went back to their site and put in my old phone as the one I'm using, and so far, they've not cut off my internet service. While it's nowhere as fast as 3G, nor visually as 'wow' as the newest touch-screen phones with Android OS... it's the useful kick I needed to make me happy and at the right price.Now I have a phone that has great voice quality, speedy bluetooth uploads (took some photos and got them to my desktop very quickly), easy texting, GPS (tried that today too, and had it plot some routes with great success), music player and other assorted goodies that for me, are really sweet!I'll be keeping this phone and may end up adding more texts or more minutes to my phone plan simply because it's a joy to use.  Has held a good charge too, even with lots of web browsing, texting and playing music. I like it and would recommend it to the consumer who wants a feature packed phone, that while not the 'latest and greatest', does a damn good job at the things it was designed to do.4/48/10:T-Mobile's Web2Go is called 'unlimited web for phones'.  I had added it (free for 1 month), but decided $10 was more than I wanted to pay for this basic stuff (not G3).  Today when I went to take it off, T-Mobile offered it for $5 a month, calling it \"Preferred Phone First Unlimited Web Only\".  I snagged it and upgraded to a non-contract extending plan: 'Even More Plus 500 Talk + Text' which is $39.95 a month.  Now I have unlimited text (video, IM, Photo, or text), unlimited weekends and evenings, unlimited web and 500 anytime minutes for $44.99 plus taxes.  The Even More Plus 500 Talk, Text and Web unlimited is priced at $59.95 plus tax... so I feel really good about both the T-Mobile deal AND keeping this wonderful phone!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wonderful phone if you can overlook a few little things and get the right plan", "unixReviewTime": 1272153600, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2010"}

It's a good phone, but I like the iPhone better. So today I went out and bought an iPhone 3G. The graphics on the E71 just can't compare. Plus the iPhone has so many great applications that Nokia just does not have. My call quality issue arose from a problem with at&t;, that they are working on at my office. It seems better now. The 3G iPhone is quite a bit better than the 2G version I had.Original Review: I owned a 2G Iphone for about a year, and was getting frustrated by the Iphones bugginess and poor phone quality. So I decided to go phone hunting and settled on the E71. These 2 phones are very different. The Iphone has great graphics and nice applications, but is a pretty basic device. The E71 is a more powerful device, with less graphics ability, but is a better phone. And that was my primary need, #1 a good phone, and #2 a PDA. The Nokia excels at both.I like the VOIP options of the E71. The music player is good too, and can use up to an 8GB micro SD card for music storage.Setting up my Gmail and exchange server accounts was fast and easy.The E71 battery lasts at least twice as long as my 2G Iphone.The call quality is the best of any phone I have owned. I am very happy with the switch. I even switched my SIM card back to my Iphone last week to see how I felt about the Iphone. I switched back to the E71 at lunch. I missed the E71, and I don't like the touchscreen keypad of the Iphone.The E71 is not an Iphone and is not really comparable. The E71 is more like a turbocharged  Treo or Blackberry. The Iphone has better graphics, and if you need graphics, the Iphones the better choice. But the E71 is more stable and does not require rebooting, which my Iphone did.I also like the physical size and feel of the E71. It's lighter and thinner than the Iphone.

I was highly impressed with the Nokia E71, except for one essential.  Due to a hearing problem, I keep my cell phone on vibrate 100% of the time.  I tried this one in my pocket, and in a good quality waist/belt case, and could never feel it even though I'd just called it myself from our land line, and knew full well that it was ringing.  Only when I held the phone in my hand directly could I feel it - vibration was exceptionally weak.Why so harsh if the rest of the phone is so good?  Because I can't conceive of a cell phone without a usable vibrate option.  Even if I had good hearing in both ears, there are times when only the vibrate option is appropriate (school, church, work meetings, etc.).  Without it, I consider there to be no reason to own it.  No vibrate option makes for a no-go for me.I ended up getting a Blackberry Curve, and really like it, but I'd still rather have the Nokia E71 after only a couple of days using it - just as long as it had a decent vibrator.There is one \"be aware\" item with this phone - apparently NONE of the major US carriers offers this phone as an option.  I don't know why, since T-Mobile does offer it in Europe.  But I was not deterred by that, and found out that at least T-Mobile tech suppport can still be quite useful even with this phone (I had a data-transfer issue right after I got it, and T-Mobile was able to get me through the issue quite satisfactorily.Bottom Line: except for the vibrator being very weak, this would otherwise have ended up with at least a 4-star rating, and very likely 5 stars.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "GREAT phone - read review for 2-star reason", "unixReviewTime": 1272672000, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2010"}

However, I realized that it's not as what's hyped up to be.  The memory didn't come with the phone so I had to go out and buy one separately last night and then the map features doesn't even load but prompts many questions over and over again then it crashes.  Furthermore, I had to open the battery case then disconnect in order for the phone to work again!  The GPS doesn't work either since I have the old AT&T; service and I don't have the data plan.  I thought the GPS was a feature like you get from buying GPS separately in which it doesn't require internet service but satellite only. The short-cut email feature doesn't work either! I tried many ways to get it right but it keeps prompting me with same messages over and over again. So I had to log on to the web site feature then log into Yahoo then get my email that way, so what's the short-cut feature for if it doesn't work? Also, I had a difficult time to find where to delete the email account once you created one??!!  The number buttons are really small so when you just want to dial a number you really have to look for the right button to push.  All other features and icons are really small as well and too many to really understand which one is which.  I guess I'm used to having iPhone's bigger icons and user friendliness and now this Nokia is a big disappointment.  I wouldn't be complaining too much if this E71 hadn't been over $300 dollars. If it were only around $200 then I would give it an average rating instead of only one star. For $300 you can do much better. In fact, iPhone is only couple hundred more and worth it. I just didn't like the battery life on iPhone so I gave this E71 a try.  Before I close, I should mention that the camera/flash seems to work fine and the battery life on E71 seems to be awesome and long lasting once you fully charge it.  I may just get the cheaper version of the Nokia since I can't use email, map and GPS features from this phone.  So beware of these complaints before you order this phone for $300.Edit:Someone responded to my review by saying that since I didn't have a data plan I couldn't download maps and emails.

The more time I spent with the phone, the more features I discovered.  Because it has been protected by a full cover leather case, has survived many accidents including being lost overnight in the snow.Attached to my belt, has been with me for probably 16 hours per day while at work and during leisure activities.  Has been in the ON Mode 24/7 because it is used as my alarm clock and the 3-G always active receiving e-mails anytime, faster than the server that sends these to my computer.  Average battery life is typically of Nokia and needs recharging every third day with regular use.Using an 8GB Micro SD card, many applications have been installed plus 50 MP-3 albums, podcasts, like 20 video clips, several long MS-Word documents, PP Presentations, Excel charts and even PDFs plus ten full movies compressed to 300 MB each under AVI format.  The reception with ATT's 3-G has always been great; no complains.Two weeks ago after falling from my belt, the phone developed the well documented \"Turn Off Syndrome\" when any key was pressed.  Checked the Nokia Website and seems that has become a fairly common issue for many users.  Tried all the solutions posted but none of them worked, so I ordered another unlocked phone, the Nokia 5800.  This new phone is a great device (will review it soon; still testing battery life), but since it was not a replacement for the E-71 and not finding other phones I would consider as true replacements, did erased \"everything\" on the device and installed the new firmware (300.XXX.XX) the original version was 100.XXX.XX.  Also, installed the new software (for the S 60 OS) from Nokia's site.To my surprise, the problem was solved and it's great that Nokia's upgraded firmware has some new features including a much faster Internet browser and four new wallpapers that make easy reading the relatively small fonts and make the Icons more noticeable.  Two of these wallpaper screens are red and the other two in black shades; very nice!  The only think I am noticing is that battery recharging time has decreased from three to two days.  But that is still a considerable time compared with the berries collection, the I-Phone and the many other new phones that run Windows Mobile.Thus, it has been a year of satisfaction with this attractive device and have no major complains.  Even though I have tried most of the other keyboarded phones including the berries the palms and the Samsung's Blackjack & Jack, none has the conveniences of the E-71 as for fast and accurate messaging.  The wired mic & phones are history and the device is paired to three others, two Plantronics headphones and the Garmin GPS.  In conclusion, the more time I spend with the phone, the more I like it and the harder it has been to find a proper replacement for it.  Thus, I have planned to keep it as my business phone for at least 2010 but getting a new battery.  Pictures of the phone have been included.Initial Review; January 2009:  After reading several reviews, I ordered a Nokia E-71 Unlocked US Version from Amazon. This is the first Unlocked Phone I get and will comment on \"unlocked devices\" at the end. I selected a Nokia E-71 after having tried several phones which included the LG Incite, RIM's Storm, Samsung's Omnia and the Blackberry Bold. Why did I not stay with any of these phones? Basically because of very few and subtle advantages found on the Finnish product wanting a phone of proper size capable of my e-mail, multimedia and web searching needs.With the E-71 Nokia's has been able to offer consumers a beautiful stainless steel device full of features that most users will probably never even know that they have on their hands. From an Infrared Transmitter, to literally reading your messages so you actually listen to e-mails instead of having to read small fonts on the screen to voice dialing, an integrated GPS and a full multimedia system that allows you to see videos, podcasts and listen to your favorite music. Not to mention good quality of reception, sound, a great Symbian OS, up to ten e-mails and all powered by the well known long lasting Nokia battery.The shortcomings are only few in my opinion. The first one is the micro jack for the headphones and microphone. The second one is the micro USB port for connection with the computer. Nokia should have used the standard ones like other companies have been doing. The third shortcoming is the small screen fonts (even on the large setting) that make difficult reading some e-mails and MM messages. Besides these three, I consider that all the plusses make these limitations not significant.Unlike most American products, Nokia uses a port for charging the phone separate than the one used for connecting the phone to the computer. This has pros and cons but for me is better leaving the phone charging wherever I want instead of needing to leave it next to the computer in another area of the house. As well, if you are away from home and do not have a computer, the charger will do it by itself.The E-71 has a full Qwerty keyboard and this is what probably makes this phone the best choice for persons that need or like to type considerably. What makes the keyboard unique is its design. First, the keys with numbers have been located in the center. Those of us who have used the Bold and other RIM products have struggled when trying to type the numbers 4 and 7 in a sentence because they are immediate next to the only ALT key of the RIM keyboards. You will not have this problem with the E-71.Nokia has wisely assigned lowercase keys to two of the most important characters when surfing the web or composing e-mails. These are the @ and the period ( . ). On other devices such as the RIM ones, these have to be activated trough ALT plus the corresponding key. On the Nokia keyboard the @ is immediately left of the space bar and the period is slightly up and to the right. These become very convenient when typing.This keyboard has a very attractive charcoal colored (almost black) on the grey version. In order to differentiate the keys with numbers, the upper half of these have a lighter color. Thus, if you turn the phone slightly downwards, 12 keys in the center show up in grey color. These have the numbers 0 to 9 and the # and * keys often used when accessing message centers and companies. In order to have all these in just three rows of keys, Nokia has placed the zero to the right of the number 9. Not what we are used to but quite clever.Compared with the Bold the keys are somewhat smaller and no space between them. But, their convex shape makes typing relatively easy even for persons with big thumbs. One thing that works for me is having the phone flat on a surface and type with the index fingers.On the upper part of the keyboard, ten keys have been arranged in a not so usual way which includes the square that substitutes the \"rolling ball mouse\". At first was sort of difficult to use it but when you web browse, the logic behind becomes evident.This is one of the few phones that come with a leather strap which attaches on the lower left corner of the device. This is extremely convenient when you receive a call and need to rapidly take out the phone from a pant pocket or if it's being carried inside your jacket or coat.The installed software has many features which are found only in more expensive devices. Their Office Suite has even the Acrobat reader and Word and Excel documents can be edited. Not so with PowerPoint, Access and Publisher but that' Ok since the screen on cell phones is relatively small. I guess that the IR Transmitter will be useful sending a document to a printer so you'll be able to see/read it in full size.Thus, the E-71 is a product with multiple capabilities that can be used as a phone, a micro computer, a messaging system and even as a substitute of your Personal Video Player to watch your favorite videos while commuting or flying. Even though it was intended for companies (that's why the E; for Enterprises) the device can easily make its way into the average consumer. Needless to say, I consider this Nokia the best bang for your buck in the current world of smart phones. I have had mine for four weeks and plan on keeping it.Currently there are two versions of the phone being sold \"unlocked\"; the US version and the European version. At the time I wrote this (01/09) those that plan to use the ATT network needed to get the US version. In contrast, T-Mobile users need to get the European version. This is because of the different operating frequencies of the carriers.Why should someone get an Unlocked Phone instead of buying one with a plan? Well, it's what you will end up playing with the plan for the next two years. Carriers actually make more money out of the contract (at least $2,500) than of the alleged discounted price of the phone ($250).I have been a customer of Cingular/ATT since the first cell phones came out in the nineties and do not complain of their reception in general. As well have had Sprint and Verizon but only because of reception problems with ATT in specific geographical areas I've lived.But, this time I bought an \"unlocked\" phone because I did not want to be \"locked\" with a two year contract with any company.

I had been wanting this phone for quite a while because of its businesslike appearance and features, and to replace my old and somewhat lacking LG KP500 Cookie.Here are the main pros and cons of this phone.PROS:-Amazing Quality and Form: The phone is wrapped in a chrome metallic surface and just screams quality. Just to hold the phone is a treat. All the buttons are where you expect them to be (and all feel well made), and little touches like a gripped backing add a feeling of extra stability to the phone. Compared to the somewhat plasticy Blackberry, this feels way better.-User Interface: The somewhat complicated (see Cons) Symbian UI is excellent for both the businessman and the personal user. It provides extended customization and easy access to Email and all of your apps right from the home screen. Notifications also pop up on the home screen, and a notification light blinks. You can also switch between two Home screens, a business one and a personal one.-3G and Wi-Fi connectivity: My current plan is T-Mobile's Pay-As-You-Go plan, which only runs on basic GPRS technology, so I can't actually comment on the 3G connectivity. The Wi-Fi functions work incredibly fast, with no issues connecting. Setting up Wi-Fi is a breeze, and it remembers saved networks.-Camera and Video: The 3MP camera is pretty good. It works well in both low light and sunlight, and offers autofocus, flash, and many different color overlays. Video has good quality as well. There is also a front-facing camera, but I haven't gotten around to using it yet.-Apps and Ovi App Store: Tons of Apps can be downloaded to this Phone. Facebook, Myspace, Youtube, QuickOffice, a Mail Client, and IM all come preloaded. Not much to say here, everything works as it should. Note: Skype and Opera Mobile are also available for download and they both work incredibly well on this phone.-E-Mail Client: Amazing, Robust Client... Much better than Blackberry or iOS's included clients. Allows for autosync and multiple addresses, with tons of customization options.CON:-UI COULD be hard to use for some, mainly because of the somewhat disorganized folders.-Ovi Store sometimes freezes up on me and I have to force exit the app.-Ovi PC software is a bit buggy.OTHER:-Battery Life: Not really a con, not really a pro; 2 days with heavy use. With minimal use, it lasts up to four days.Overall, I would easily recommend this phone to any \"heavy\" cell phone user, especially at the somewhat low price tag.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect, Just a Few Minor Issues", "unixReviewTime": 1293580800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "AIVU1J51MJ9O2", "asin": "B001BZH2QI", "reviewerName": "Vaughn \"The answer man!\"", "helpful": [18, 18], "reviewText": "I have owned the e71x for over two years.  I still have it and will probably use it until it dies. This phone has one shining feature; it is as tough as nails! I love the size, features and durability of the e71x. But all is not perfect in paradise.  Although this phone has a lot to love, it has a lot of problems.  So here is an idea of what is like to own the e71x.THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE E71X:1. The OS:  Nokia stopped supporting the Symbian S60 3rd Edition OS almost immediately after they released it.  There are lots of glitches with this OS that need to be fixed via updates, but Nokia does not care.  There are thousands of e71x users like me that have begged them to fix the problems with this OS and we get no response. The e71x hit the market about the time of the Iphone and it did not get the huge reception that Nokia wanted, so the just abandoned it. That really stinks and shows poor character for a large company like Nokia.2. App Support:  If I were going to buy this phone again, I would buy the e71 and not the e71x.  The e71 and the e71x are identical except for the OS.  Somehow, even though they claim to have the same OS (Symbian S60 3rd Edition), some apps that will go work on the e71, will not work on the e71x. So there a lot fewer apps for the e71x.  But what really irritates me is that of the few apps that are available for the e71x, 9 out of 10 are not stand alone apps, but require network data support to even start up.  So if you are like me, a person who thinks it is dumb to pay $60 a month for a data plan on a phone that has wifi, then you will be ticked to find that most of the apps for the e71x require a data plan.  I don't mean that some of their feature will not work if you don't have a data plan, I mean that they will not even start up if they don't find a data connection. And just in case your are thinking of it; no, they will not recognized a wifi connection. So after two years of owning this phone, I have only found a couple apps that will work on it without a data plan.  I can tell you positively that, they people that engineered the OS for the e71x, deliberately made it in a way so as to force you to buy a data plan.  I paid top dollar to buy my phone so that I would not have pay for a data a plan that I would not use.  It really, really chaps me that AT&T; and Nokia conspired together to do what they did.3. Battery Life:  The battery life of the e71x is pretty bad.  I seldom make it through a day without having to charge my phone. The most I get out of it is a couple hours of talk time.  I have bought new OEM batteries for it, but they die just as quick as the old ones.  And just wait until you turn wifi on.  Oh my!  You can literally watch the battery meter go down.  I am not sure what kills the battery so fast, because this phone has a relatively large battery pack compared to other phones I have used.  For one thing, there are no manual controls for screen brightness. The e71x relies on a light sensor to adjust the the screen brightness, but it has never worked on my e71x, so my screen is always at it's brightest.  There is a slider control to adjust the sensitivities of the light sensor, but adjusting it has no effect on my phone.  Lots of other people have complained about this to Nokia, but as I have said before, Nokia does not care.  Oh, and the phone has a light breathing function when not in use that is impossible to turn off.  Basically, the phone sits there and slowly lights up and slowly dims, as if it is breathing. So even when you are not using it, it running the battery down.4. Wifi:  The wifi card on the e71x, is pretty weak, but it does work (for the 20 minutes you have battery life). The problem with it is really related to the OS.  The e71x has three idles screen themes (really should be called Layouts) and on each of the three themes appears a link to your wifi function.  So say you are sitting in a Burger King and want to check if there is a wifi hotspot.  You can quickly whip out your phone, click on the wifi link and be scanning for a signal.  Great right? Well, unfortunately that link causes your phone to crash three to four times a day, in what is call the infamous \"Idle Screen Theme Error\".  The phone will crash, sound an alarm and then give you the Idle Screen them error, and then come back online.  At first you don't notice anything wrong with your idle screen theme until you try to use your wifi.  That is when you notice that the wifi link is gone.  You then spend the next three days trying figure out what has happened, only to discover that you have once again been the victim of the glitchy Symbian S60 3rd Edition OS and that Nokia has no plans to fix the problem.  Now you are stuck with having to dig five menus deep into the phone settings to get to the wifi function, or go through the process of resetting your idle screen theme several times a day.5. GPS:  The e71x does have a gps, but it might as well not.  It takes no less then 5 minutes for it to find satellite signal if you are standing dead still in the wide open. But the really bad thing is that I have not been able to find a single stand alone app that will work with the GPS that does not required a data plan. If you have a data plan and are willing to stand out in the open for five minutes every time you want to use the gps, I guess it might work for you, but for me it is useless.6. Camera: The camera on the e71x is pretty bad when compared to other cameras of other smartphones with 3.2MP cameras.  Have even seen 2MP smartphone cameras that do better.  I actually used a panel made up of some friends to judge the quality of two other smartphones (3.2MP & 2MP) against the e71x.  The e71x lost hands down.  I seldom use it as a result of the poor quality.THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE E71X:1. Size and Durability:  The e71x is a brick. It is really small for all the features it has and it is built more sturdier then any other smartphone I have held.  This was the main reason I bought the e71x in the first place and it has not disappointed me in this regard. I bought a slim anti-slip gel case for it when I first got it and it has been great.  It has fallen a few times on concrete, but the phone still looks and functions like it did when it was brand new.2. Keyboard & Buttons:  I am a big man with fat fingers.  At first I though I would have a problem with the small keyboard on the e71x, but after a few days of break-in time I was typing away.  Like the rest of the phone, the keyboard and the buttons feel solid and after two years of heavy use, still look brand new.  Not one single letter or symbol is faded.3. Screen:  The screen is bright and sharp, even if it is small (you can't have everything).  I have used screen protectors from day one and it still looks great.4. Advanced voice calling support:  I hate holding a phone to my ear, so I use a bluetooth 99% of the time.  I also hate having to pull my phone out of my pocket and look through my address book (over 300 entries) to find a  number to call.  But I don't have to because the e71x has advance phone calling support. I just have to push and hold the button on my Plantronics Voyager PRO Plus headset and speak the name of the person I want to call.  Wallah!  That is as easy as it gets.5. Text to Speech Function:  The e71x has text to speech functions and will speak out the name of the person calling if they are in your address book.  So say you are driving your car and your phone rings.  It's in your pocket and it is difficult to get it out to see who is calling.  Not a problem with the e71x.  It rings and then says the name of the person (if they are in your address book).  If the call is from someone not in address book it just rings, but this tells you that you don't know the person that well and you can decide to let them leave a voicemail if you don't want to take an anonymous call.6. Bluetooth:  Unlike some phone that don't like (or are software restricted from) transferring data with other Bluetooth devices, the e71x seems to be able to connect and transfer to any other Bluetooth device that will talk to it.  I Like freedom and hate it when manufactures restrict their products to work only with in their engineered limitations (I am talking about you APPLE!).Well, that is about it.  You should know all you need to know about the e71x now.  If this phone had a better OS (or at least better support from Nokia), better camera, better battery life and better apps support, it would be a five star phone.  That being said, it is still pretty darn good phone for phone and texting functions, and I would not shy away from buying another, but never at full price again.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Small & Tough with lots of features but software is glitchy.", "unixReviewTime": 1326240000, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2012"}

Chan \"Bike commuter\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "I use my phone for 1-2 hours of phone calls, an hour of email, and maybe a little web and gps thrown in. I charge it every other day. Things that I like are the basic design, sturdiness and quality.  Call reception is excellent.  I previously had two Samsungs, and always had numerous dropped calls each day.  Reliability of radio service is much better now, which is saying a great deal considering I use the least reliable network (begins with \"A\").  It comes with a wired headset and I actually prefer that to my bluetooth earpiece.  Sound quality is important.  The speakerphone works but isn't loud enough in my car or outside.The keyboard is a little cramped and takes getting used to.  The dictionary works great and mostly predicts what I am trying to type.  You can add any word to the dictionary easily as you type.  I have g-mail and I found both the Nokia mail app and g-mail's own app disappointing.  The Nokia app doesn't display html messages without opening a separate browser--not good if you want to quickly scan through messages.  The g-mail app opens .pdf files within its program, but loses document formatting.  You cannot choose to open an attachment with a program of your own choosing (sounds like the Microsoft strategy is growing within the g-camp).  I found \"Profimail\" which works great for me.  It works more like a true desktop mail client and can update your IMAP folders so you can carry all your important messages with you.  You can download attachments to any location and open them with the application of your own choosing (like Acrobat Reader).  The mail client meshes well with the Nokia address book.  It is totally software worth trying.  I purchased it after only a couple of days of trying it out.There's another default screen app called \"Active Notes\", which I thought would make saving documents a snap, but I was again disappointed.  Sometimes I edit emails for people.  I copy emails, paste and create a document, edit and then send the edited document back as an attachment that can be copied and pasted into a new email.  I tried using Active Notes and it would only attach as a .zip file.  I replaced the Active Notes icon with Quick Office, which works well and saves text documents as .txt and .doc.For gps and maps, I use Google maps for Symbian.  The gps works quickly and accurately.  I'm a guy and wouldn't use turn-by-turn directions even if they were erotically whispered into my ear.  I just want to find my location and look at a map.  While house-hunting recently, I used it to look at the satellite views too.  I recommend Google maps and it's free.The browser mostly works well, and I salute any browser that can display modern web pages on a 240x320 pixel screen.  I tried Opera Mini, but didn't see anything better, so I just use the Nokia included browser.  Speaking of internet, I also use my phone with the included USB cable as a tethered modem.  The Nokia PC Suite of software makes that pretty effortless.  Too bad the USB cable doesn't also charge the battery.  I purchased a separate USB charging cable that adapts to the charging connector on the phone.There are a few little irritating quirks i found.  You can briefly push the power button to switch to different modes, like \"Silent\".  Unfortunately the default setting on Silent mode is to not alert or even vibrate upon receiving a call.  I missed a whole days worth of phone calls because of that one.  I later edited the Silent mode to include a vibrating alert.  That seemed a little lame to me.When the phone drops into the standby screen it displays the time without the backlite.  When you press the home key, the menu displays and when you press the menu key, the home screen displays--Totally backwards.The mute button is right between the volume keys and you can easily mute your own voice while trying to adjust the earpiece volume if you are not careful.The menus are confusing and completely non-intuitive.  Trying to find out how to change something like a hot-key can take a lot of trial and error.  An update to the Symbian OS is going to be necessary to keep Nokia competitive.The best case I found is from Beyzacases.  They are a Turkish company that makes fine leather cases.  I received mine within 3 days of ordering from them.Lastly, the fact that it is unlocked (but works best on US ATT networks) is the best feature of all.  You will pay half what you would pay for data if you buy a subsidized phone with a contract agreement.  When you remain out of contract your carrier's CSRs will treat you with more respect and care.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unlocked phones are the way to go!", "unixReviewTime": 1246579200, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2009"}

Main reasons for looking for a replacement was to have a Qwerty keyboard, 3G connectivity, GPS, being unlocked, Quad-phone, video conference capability, a decent set of commercial or free application availability, especially editing MS Word type documents, expansion (via memory cards) and a decent camera.I am happy with E71 - EXCEPT the camera.  When it was originally advertised, the 3.2Mp camera seemed too tempting to have and sounded as a nice upgrade from my SE K550i - Boy I was wrong :(  the 2Mp pictures my SE K550i was/is taking are much much better compared to E71.

It finds the wireless connection points really fast, call quality is nice, sound is very decent, A-GPS is amazingly fast and the Nokia Maps software is very nice (though expensive for an online service in my opinion) - the Google Maps works as a champ with no turn by turn voice help (if you don't care).  Some reported that Germin XT is another option to have already downloaded maps to avoid online expense in addition to the data charges.  The default browser is very nice and fast.

It has a soft, padded yet durable inner layer to protect the phone on both sides, a good adjustment strap that is strong and lots of good outer protective heavy duty nylon. The three PALS webbing loops on the back work great for horizontal carry on my 5-stitch 1.75\" Wilderness Products belt (a perfect fit!). The metal clip however is screaming for a replacement solution if you want to carry this vertically on your belt or gear. For me, the case slipped off over the metal clip on the first day I used it when it was attached to my Maxpedition Versipack... I thought I lost my $300 phone, until I found it on the floor of my truck... whew! So ah, don't use the clip under any circumstances... it's just not worth losing your pricey smartphone.I tried to replace the metal clip with limited success, after lots of testing, becuase I really wanted to be able to safely mount this vertically on my Versipack. I first went with a 3\" TieTac, but that resulted in too much back and forth movement so I added another Tietac, but that was too tight due to them overlapping (resulting in them bulging out, along with the case, an extra .75\" more than it ideally should (plus it is a PITA to remove quickly). I then tried some Blade-Tech Tec-Loks. I was hoping I could just slip the Large Tec-Lok though the PALS straps... no luck...way too big. The small (1.5\") Tec-Lok barely fit under one and a half PALS straps with a lot of force, and with a lot of wiggling, I was able clear the second strap in order to close it. But, with two PALS straps bunched up together in that small Tec-Loc, I couldn't get it to close on my Versipack mount points (doh!). To add insult to this attempt, I then realized that I couldn't even use it in that configuration for belt carry, since I wear a 1.75\" gun belt daily (Doh, Doh!). Then I found that it's a major PITA to remove the small Tec-Lok once it is installed across two PALS, without doing potential serious damage to the PALS straps (trust me on this one!). I was finally able to back out the Tec-Lok to just one strap, which then allowed me to snap in under the Veripack mounting point for a near perfect solution. It's still a no-go for vertical carry on a 1.75\" or large belt though, so don't even think about buying this for duty belt use.Summary: Wear this thing horizontally on your 1.75\" belt (or smaller) and you are good to go.... its a fine solution, which is why I gave it 5-Stars. But... Maxpedition didn't think this one through for integration with their own Versipack, or any other vertical carry solution. If you wear a 1.5\" belt or smaller, and/or just want to get it on your Versipack, then buy a small Tec-Lok (currently available here on Amazon), and slide in under just one of the three PALS... it's a tight fit, but that is overall a good thing, because then you don't get any movement when wearing it. If you want to also wear it on a 1.75\" belt, then you will need to remove the small Tec-Lok to do so, but it isn't too much work to do so.Note to Maxpedition: On the next revision of this product, you might consider adding four \"burn holes\" (or small grommets) though the back of the case, aligned with 2.25\" Tec-Lok mounting holes... that would cost you next to nothing, and allow for easy user mounting after purchase (You'd probably quadruple your sales numbers because then LEOs could mount them to their duty belts (lots of the uniform LEOs I work with have already asked me about this case!)If this review helped you out, please hook me up with a \"Helpful\" click.

In the past I've avoided cases with spring metal clips like the plague, instead opting for those with plastic clips.  My concern with the spring metal clips was that, with the distinct bottom \"hook\" that the plastic clips usually have, cases with simple metal clips (including those covered in vinyl or leather) would too easily slip off of my belt.  Then again, the plastic clips are far from perfect, since they do have a tendency to break.  Maxpedition's metal clip, on the other hand, is the best solution... it's not going to break, and because of its design, it does not readily come off of the belt without deliberately doing so.  But just to emphasize, you MUST reposition the clip on the holster's loops as previously mentioned... without this adjustment, the case will almost certainly slide right off of the metal clip (leaving the metal clip hooked to your belt, but your phone/holster on the ground).

In other reviews there are complaints of it coming off a belt,  if you do as other reviewers have said you won't have any problem. Just weave the bottom of the clip on top of the 3rd strap. The clip is strong and made of metal. If you want to use it horizontally you can thread your belt thru the fabric straps. This holster will not keep your phone clean as the top is open but that is good if you want to plug in earphones. The inside is of a soft material to protect the screen. Construction is heavy duty and should last a long time. The only negative I could mention is that the strap locking clip (sort of like luggage clips but heavier) I found hard to align to lock it. This is because not only is there the two snap out clips but a third center locator prong. This was square ended and a fairly tight fit into the grove. Sometimes I struggled to get it started. It really isn't a problem once you realize the issue and do what I did. I took a fine file and rounded the corners on the center prong, no more trouble!!

HATE them, and thus rarely use them. They're either a PITA to install, make the display look like crap, or a combination of both.As most iPhone users know, the iPhone screen is made of glass and thus pretty hard to scratch. Given this fact, along with my disposition towards screen protectors, I had no desire to put one on my new iPhone 3Gs. Enter last week when I bought an Otter Box, and ran into the famous \"oil slick\" problem. I tried the baby powder trick, which worked to a point, but still left \"rainbow\" streaks when using the screen. I heard from several commenters (thank you!)that using a non-glare screen protector would work, so I hesitantly headed down to the Apple store (READ: I overpaid) to see what was available. They all looked the same to me, but the Power Support brand seemed to be recommended by both Apple employees and random store shoppers, so I picked it up. $15 and 20 minutes later I was on my way home, preparing myself for the ridiculous amount of \"installation cursing\" to ensue.All of you religious Amazon folk will be happy to know, not one obscenity was uttered! This was by far the easiest and most pain-free screen protector installation I have ever had the pleasure (/sarcasm off) of doing! I'm quite sure this is a side effect of being designed with a high-quality and thicker material than the dime store protectors. You simply clean your iPhone glass with a micro fiber cloth, spray it with can air (if available), then apply the pre-film, which effectively removes and left over dirt or hair. Of course it goes without saying, turn off any fans and try to be in a place as free of airborne particles as possible. Once you're ready, peel off the white pre-film, then line up the actual screen protector and peel a SMALL amount of the backing off, pressing it down on the glass and pulling more while you go. Do NOT pull the backing off all at once and then try to apply. This is why you get bubbles. Once you're done you still may have a few small bubbles. Simply rub them with your finger towards the closest outer edge and viola! You're done. If you don't see the bubbles follow your finger to the outer edge, there's probably a piece of dirt and/or a hair stuck to it. Simply follow the troubleshooting steps included to rectify this problem.This thing has literally improved my iPhone experience dramatically. The satin feel actually makes your finger slide much better, thus having better control. It's anti-glare properties are also top notch, and do not affect the display at all. There is a bit of \"sparkle\" but its not really noticeable. Think LCD monitors before they started putting that super gloss on them. It worked great in the Otterbox, preventing the watermark, but I have since moved to a difference case (Showcase Iphone 3G Black), as the Otterbox was just too beefy for my use.In all, I can highly recommend this protector.

Until recently, I had to compromise by getting my sister's discarded 7100 kept that plugged in and swapping batteries every night when I came home-- because her 7100 had a different malfunction that made her phone inoperable.I just upgraded to the Curve in December and didn't want to go to the hassles of having that piece fall out again.  RIM finally came to their senses and added an additional port to charge the phone.  By way of the two (2) copper strips just beneath the battery cover.I bought the charge pod and have been using it for more than a month now and I can say it works great.  It's designed for the Curve, but the width of the opening is, strangely enough, wider that the phone.  So much so, that the phone slides from side to side.

I got one for my iPod classic, and it sticks to the walls of the pocket, making it difficult to take out. It gets pretty annoying to have to push your pocket back in after your case turns it inside-out. :PSo for the iPhone, I definitely wanted a hard case.  This was the perfect answer. It's a hard plastic case, but with a matte finish and a really silky feel to it.  The fit is good, and it seems to stay together pretty well.You'll still need to order a screen protector if you're worried about that (I am since the iPhone is the only phone in AT&T;'s lineup that is not eligible for insurance), since there is no screen protection with this case.The sturdiness of it is very comforting, since I have a tendency to unintentionally crush things in my pockets (I commute on a motorcycle, and that kind of thing happens), and while I don't necessarily believe that I would hurt my iPhone, the peace of mind goes a long way. :)Edit 08/08/2008: Added a couple of photos so you can see how it fits on the iPhone 3G.  Also, I'd highly recommend this case combined with this screen protector: Apple iPhone Screen Protector.  When put on right, the outside edges of the protector are 100% covered by the edges of this case, making it impossible to get those rough edges that can happen over time with some of the lesser screen protectors.And now I'm off to review the screen protector. :-)Edit 08/26/2008:  First, a question was asked in the comments on this review - the case in the seller's photo shows one single rectangular hole that exposes the necessary components, while the one that I received (see my customer images) has two separate openings. I purchased mine from this seller, so if I were you I would expect to receive one that looks like the one in my photos rather than the seller photo.  Personally, I like mine better, but that's my own opinion. :)Second, I was sent a message privately asking about the openings on the top front of the case and what they are for. The holes expose three components in total -- the speaker, the light sensor (which varies the brightness of the screen based on ambient light, if you have that option turned on in Settings), and the \"Face Detector\", which is a sensor that turns the phone's screen off during a call when you bring it up to your head, and turns the screen back on when you take it away.----------------Edit 04/14/2009:----------------I'm seeing a lot of really negative reviews lately, and one in particular (dated 04/11/2009) that states that the manufacturer has changed the design since I bought mine (in August 2008).  According to that reviewer, the quality of this new version is inferior to the old one.  So I would advise caution at this point.  I can't speak to the quality of the latest model personally since I have not purchased one, but I would hate to have someone buy this item based upon my review and then be disappointed when the item is not as I described.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Now THAT'S a good case.", "unixReviewTime": 1217894400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2008"}

Basically, it does what it says.  It protects your privacy.  No one can see the screen unless they're pretty much directly in front of it.However... this is a two-piece set.  It comes with a glossy screen protector that protects the whole front of the iphone.  You're supposed to put that down first, then put the privacy film on top of it.  I did it backwards, and that screwed everything up.But even if you did it right, here are the four problems associated with it:1. the film is quite thick - try to picture this - it's about 3 times as thick as the glossy screen protector (the standard screen protector that comes with or without the privacy film).  Keep in mind the glossy screen protector is super thin and when you have that on your phone you hardly notice it.  The privacy film though is thick enough that it creates a ridge that your finger can definitely feel as it runs across it.(By the way, the privacy film just covers the lighted part of the iphone screen - not the entire face).  So the privacy film sits on top of the glossy screen protector - and there's this ridge there.  A ridge that can get caught on things when you put the phone in your pocket or purse.  I'm sure it won't last long in daily use.I accidentally installed all of this backwards from the way they recommended.  I put the privacy film down first, then the glossy protector on top of it.  It works okay, and it eliminates the \"ridge\" problem.  The film will now not get caught on anything and ripped off because it's covered by the glossy protector.  However, the glossy protector doesn't fit over it perfectly - leaving a lot of bubbles outside of the screen area.  This is no doubt why they recommend installing it the other way around!2. The privacy film really dims your screen.3. With this doubling up of films and protectors the screen loses a noticeable amount of sensitivity, and you have to press harder for it to recognize your commands.  This is really a pain after awhile.4. The privacy film got a tiny little bubble that just won't go away.  I can push it around with my thumb, but it just comes back when I'm finished!It sounds like a great idea in theory, but I'm not sure in practice it's really going to be worth it.  I find myself now weighing the benefits & costs.Benefit:  no one can see my screen but meCosts:  I have to look at a much darker screen, there are little bubbles that can't be removed, and the whole thing's not going to last very long anyway!Then I think:  privacy protection sounds good, but really - in real life - how often has my privacy been violated by someone looking at my screen?  I'm not sure it has ever happened.  And if it did happen, it has caused me no harm.

The magnetic closure has not interfered with my iPhone in any way, and the belt loops make this holster very, very secure. The phone is easily removed when needed. I bought this to replace theDLO Leather Holster Case for iPhone 3G, 3G S (Black), when the belt clip began to become loose; if you want to make SURE that you never loose your iPhone because of a lost holster, the PC Microstore holster with belt clip AND belt loops is the way to go. I had the unfortunate experience of losing a Motorola Razr when another holster's belt clip slipped off my pocket; an honest person turned the phone in, but not before it had been stepped on and the glass front broken. Do you really want to risk losing your Iphone in such an accident? At the offering price, I feel that this iPhone case is one of the best deals available on all of Amazon's web site.Follow-up, December 2009-My wife recently upgraded to an iPhone, so I ordered two more of these cases, still at a great price. While they seemed very similar to the items I received in August, they are of MUCH poorer quality- the belt loops broke in a mere three weeks of usage. I have contacted pcmicrostore about a refund or replacement through Amazon, and I'm waiting for their response. The cases received in November have a small logo on the front, but the ones I received in August did not.

That turned out to be a big key in how much I liked the case.  It was very easy to get the phone out with one hand.  The only issue I had with the DLO was that it had velcro to close the case.

It does have both a belt clip and belt loops--which added to the bulk and made the phone stick out more from my hip.

It's value decreased considerably if the price is much higher.This has about the same footprint as my iPhone.  It's about a fraction of it's weight.  Build quality is excellent.  The speaker contains a rechargeable battery and there is a clear indication of when it needs to be charged and when the charging has been completed.  More on the charger and that \"clear indication\" in a bit.Pairing with my iPhone was immediate right out of the box.  I turned on the speaker, went to the bluetooth discover screen on my phone, it picked up the unpaired device, I entered the super-secret code number (0000), and it was done.Sound quality is good (for this type of speaker).  The sound is clear, there is very little (but at least some) bass, and it doesn't sound tinny.  I bought it for playing background music on the deck and it's certainly clear enough and there's definitely enough volume for that.The description implied and it should be clearly stated that in addition to working as a speaker this also works as a speaker phone and can also pass voice commands to the phone.  In fact it works just like the Motorola S9 headset except that forward and reverse don't seem to work with my iPhone4 (and it's much more difficult to wear as a headset).The AC charger is universal (at one end); it accepts 100-240V at 50/60 Hz.Now for the minor issues:There's a very bright and annoying light that insists on flashing when music is playing. According to the (well written) manual it means there's either a call or music on standby.  Near as I can tell there isn't.  This can be easily \"fixed\" with electrical or duct tape.  :)If you want to charge the speaker from your laptop or USB charger you need to supply your own mini-USB (laptop/charger end) to micro-USB (speaker end) cable.Minor annoyances aside, this speaker is a good value.  You can share music from your mobile device at good volume and reasonable fidelity while keeping said mobile device on your person.

The sound volume is acceptable (I was able to clearly hear the voice while was driving in my SUV). When I played a music, I could regulate the volume on my phone, and it was amplified to a quite loud sound.4.

When you have the sync, the green light is slowly blinking, so you know it's in the operating mode.6. Acceptable, compact size7. Lithium battery that can be recharged (I have also purchased the car adapter with compatible USB port)8. Price comparing to competitors' prices.Cons:1. For instance, today I had to turn on/off my unit two times until the green light started blinking (a sync problem or just a minor \"misunderstanding\"?)2. The power button is shifted left-right to turn on and off, but the button itself is very thin,  and without fingernail it's difficult to change the switch position. It's annoying. I would prefer a touch-style.3. There is no clip to adjust it on your car visor. I believe, this device was designed more for playing music as an external speaker for bluetooth enabled devices.

In short, the sound of this audio frisbee (shaped like the popular CD players of a few years back, and not much larger in size) simply blew away any of the leading contenders with which I compared it.The smaller EQ5 is a nicely detailed little unit and should satisfy users not overly fastidious about the range and accuracy of musical reproduction (bass players, above all, had best stay away from it). If the EQ5 is worth the doubling of its price since the new year, then the JBL-built EQ7 would seem worth triple its former price. The sound has brightness and immediate \"presence\" lacking in speakers like the overrated Logitech Z515 (the audio in my 11\" Mac Air is almost as good). Moreover, the mid-range-- while forward, bright and clear--doesn't come at the expense of either bass or treble frequencies. Each of the pitches of the acoustic bass is clear and identifiable in the mix, while the ride cymbal sizzles with stunning verisimilitude and the grand piano resonates with transparent authenticity.The audio waves project upwards from four small speakers whose big sound (and sound stage) belies the size of their source. The unit functions equally well using AC power, or 4 AA batteries, or Bluetooth (it instantly paired with my Touch Generation 2).  Sadly, the speaker disappoints as a battery-powered unit because of the difficulty of removing the cover as well as installing the batteries.  Since I see that some dealers are asking nearly as much for the decisively inferior-sounding EQ5, I'd have to guess that the onboard rechargeable battery and convenient compactness of the EQ5 justify, in the mind of some users, the premium price.  Still, if you have a chance to listen to the EQ7 and have any interest in a unit whose fidelity is both \"high\" and \"true,\" it's doubtful that the EQ5 will remain a contender at any price.I've never heard so bright, rich, and pure a sound from anything this small. In fact, I'm surprised the EQ7 has, for the most part, been under the radar for so long. While it may no longer be the inarguable bargain that it was just several months ago, it's without doubt the \"champ,\" the best of breed among speakers of comparable size and function. After comparing a considerable number of personal portable speakers in the $20-$200 range, I'm almost shocked that anyone would give this magnificent little overachiever less  than five stars (the problematic battery compartment notwithstanding).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Home Theater Sound for Tight Space (flawed battery compartment design)", "unixReviewTime": 1299715200, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2011"}

I gave in and purchased one, and was quickly disappointed... the case just flops around and doesn't stay put on the phone.  Half the time that i'd pull my phone out of my pocket, the rubber case just fell off onto the ground.  The fact of the matter is, no matter how snug a rubber case fits on your iPhone, it still flaps around and looks messy and wants to fall off.I decided to give a hard shell casing a try instead, and this time I did as much research as I could before making a purchase.  I settled on this iFrogz Luxe case, and it was the smartest decision I could've made.  It is VERY well fitted to the phone.  Most cases seem to just \"guesstimate\" the dimensions of the iPhone, and settle for something that \"mostly fits\", but this case fits the iPhone DEAD ON.  The inside of the case is lined with some sort of fabric which protects the phone from getting scratched, and the case is so snug that you have to force the two halves together to get it to snap shut.  And let me tell you, this case stays put!  If I didn't know any better, it would seem as if this iFrogz case was the actual phone's case, not just an accessory.Form: As I mentioned, the case perfectly holds the phone, the hole for the camera lens is perfectly centered, as are the cutouts for the buttons.Finish: The case is beautiful... a metallic green finish that doesn't look gawdy, and the iFrogz logo on the back is barely noticeable (shiny black logo on a dull black finish, so you can only see it when you look at it from a certain angle)Screen protector: As if the case by itself isn't cool enough, they've thrown in a free screen protector.  It's a pain to affix it to the screen without getting bubbles and dust underneath it (such is the case with ALL screen protectors), but once it's on it stays on, is nearly invisible, and doesn't seem to affect the sensitivity of the touch screen.I'm not sure how much protection this case would offer if you drop your phone on a hard surface, but I'm pretty confident that if it fell out of my pocket onto asphalt it would be reasonably safe.  I don't think any iPhone case offers good protection from a drop that lands right on the face of the phone, so I think this case's protection in that regard is as good as any.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm very relieved that finally SOMEONE makes a perfect iPhone case!", "unixReviewTime": 1247097600, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2009"}

The case fits somewhat snugly (as it should) and may take a little fenagling to get it on the first time. The colors are great. I'll probably get another just so I can swap colors every now and then for variety. :-)Update 3/1/09:I've had this case for almost 2 months and I still really like this case. It still fits snugly and hasn't really shown any significant wear even though I dropped my phone once and I keep it in my pocket. Sometimes I forget and put it in a pocket which also has some keys or change and not only has the case held up, but the included screen protector still looks new. I do clean my phone fairly often, but a scratch is a scratch and no amount of cleaning is going to get rid of that.So far, no scratches even after carrying it in my pocket. I don't think I would put it in my pocket with my keys and go out and play basketball, but I think this case and screen protector will hold up very well under normal wear and tear.My friend who has a first generation iPhone (not 3G) really liked it and was bummed that it said it was designed only for the 3G. So, just for yucks I took off my case and just tried it on her phone and it actually DOES seem to fit just fine on a non-3G iPhone. I'm not really sure what the physical difference is between a 3G and non-3G iPhone, but the case appeared to fit nice and snug on her older non-3G iPhone.So, the long and short of it is that this case is very well designed and well worth it. Both the case and screen protector are holding up quite well under average everyday use and still look new after almost 2 months. I've seen the rubber covers and they just don't seem to look nice or last long. My friend with the iPhone has one and it's all stretched out and doesn't fit well anymore.

I want a headset that is comfortable, light weight, fits snug and does not flop around, has good sound/voice quality and decent range. I tried three models of Motorola and all of them had very poor sound quality. I then tried a Sony, but the volume was far too low. I also tired a Nokia, but the forked shaped earpiece did not feel secure. I tried other brands and models, but all of them were either poor quality or had too many negatives. I have concluded that they do not make a headset that meets all of my needs. Therefore, I am going to settle for one that at least comes close. I guess that I am just too picky.The one I am currently trying out is this Plantronic Voyager 520. My first impressions are that it is comfortable. The sound quality is good. It is lightweight and stylish. The noise cancellation is about average. I did notice something odd though. The directions say that you can answer and end calls, but nothing about redialing. Since most other headsets do have this feature, I decided to try redialing and see what happened. I simply pressed the button twice and sure enough, it did redial the last number. It seems strange that they do not tell you about that feature in the directions.After test driving this Plantronic headset for a while, I have found this headset just might meet most of my requirements I listed above so I may keep it. However, I am still going to look around and try more headsets because I want two so that I can switch occasionally just for a change.This seems to be a very good headset and I suggest you try it for yourself.UPDATE: It has been several months since I posted this review. I stopped looking for the perfect headset, for now at least, and I am keeping this Plantronic 520. Since I have used it for so long here are my final conclusions. This headset is by far the most comfortable and the voice quality is very good. In fact, in quiet areas I can hear the other person just as well on the headset as I can on the phone itself. The only problem I have found is with the noise cancellation. In windy conditions or noisy environments the person I am talking to just can not hear me clearly or understand what I am saying. All they hear is mostly noise. However, I do like everything else about the headset.

When I took the Plantronics Voyager 520 for a test drive last week the first two things that stood out immediately was the overall comfort and the superb call quality. Even outside on a windy day, performance was better then I expected.Pairing up to both my cell phone and PDA was a breeze. Mounted with a flexible silicone ear hook, rotating to either ear takes just seconds. The earpiece has nice comfortable feel to it. So comfortable in fact that on more then one occasion I forgot that I was wearing it.Outfitted with a multifunction toggle, I easily controlled the volume by sliding the toggle forward or back. Answering, disconnecting, transferring and last number redialing was done with the touch of the button. The only ping on this product is that sometimes the toggle feels a little stiff. The onboard LED flashes an intermittent blue when fully charged and continuously when in use. I get a red flashing signal when my battery is low and a pink flashing to remind me of missed calls.I like the fact that I can pair it with more than one piece of Bluetooth gear. When I was in a crowded grocery store the clarity of incoming and outgoing calls was outstanding. With my older 510 model I was unable to wear it in that environment because of its tendency to pick up almost every surrounding noise. Callers also noted the improved clarity even when I was outside on a windy day. My battery life on this feather weight model was about 7 hours in talk mode during the week and 2 days on the weekend.The Plantronics Voyager 520 comes with a charging cradle, instructions and a one year product warranty. The company's website is loaded with useful information and lists working toll free technical support phone numbers.Overall I am quite pleased with my Plantronics Voyager 520 Headset.

But I had an accident with the one that I reviewed here in 2009, so I decided to see what other Plantronics Bluetooth headsets were available.Picked up thisPlantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headsetas it had been recommended by a friend as a reasonably priced alternative, which it is.  It's certainly better than my older Motorola H500-series Bluetooth headsets, but not quite in the same league as the Plantronics Voyager PRO series, and for a number of reasons.Likes:+ Very simple setup and pairing; couldn't be easier+ Excellent battery life; easily meets 8 hours of talk time+ Comfortable earloop; swivels to fit either ear+ Excellent and clearly written instructions+ Works with Skype through the computer+ Good one-button controlsCompromises:* Wind noise higher than expected; oyager PRO series is far better* Moderate noise cancellation; Voyager PRO series is far better* Claimed range of \"up to 33 feet\" was rareDislikes:- High static levels; annoying to parties on the other end- Proprietary plug on the charger; should be a standard Micro USB- Junky plastic desk charging cradle; not worthy of the Plantronics name- Soft plastic separated on the earloop; had to fix with SuperGlue, more than onceRegular Use:As noted in the beginning, this was picked up as reasonably priced alternative to the Plantronics Voyager PRO series. I'm neutral on the design of this Voyager 520, though the chrome look could have been muted and not so glitzy, but it was the ability to communicate and sometimes for extended periods that was important. In that, this headsetdid well except for the occasional high static levels experienced, where none had been there with the older Voyager PRO (and more on this later).But... the two-piece ear loop separated and had to be glued together, and this had to be done a few times. Once I lost the soft plastic part for a couple of days and luckily found it. The last time, I cleaned both parts carefully with isopropyl alcohol before using the SuperGlue, and so far it has held. This is apparently a common problem as I found on the Plantronics site when I went to see if they had a tech solution. Plantronics needs to go back to the drawing board on this.But my biggest complaint is that this Plantronics Voyager 520 requires a proprietary plug for charging in a world that has gone to Micro USB plugs. In fact, the Plantronics Voyager PRO HD, Voyager PRO+, Discovery 975, Savor M1100, M100, and even their discontinued Explorer 240, 360 and 390 all use the universal Micro USB plugs for charging, so why should this model be different?  Plantronics needs to work on their charging connector.It may not matter that much, but note that this Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset is listed here as Item model number: 75859-01. On the Plantronics site, it's listed as P/N: 75859-01, and according to them,  the \"Product is Discontinued\" so be aware of that.All this being said, I moved on to thePlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headsetearlier this year, and like it's earlier PRO series sibling it's a 5-star offering. The Voyager 520 has been set aside as a backup, and so far it hasn't been needed.  I could have gone for thePlantronics Voyager Pro HDbut in truth didn't know if I would have used all of its extra features. There are other more economical models to pick from, such as the highly-ratedPlantronics M50(which does have micro USB charging), but as a loyal fan of this company's products, I would suggest steering away from this Voyager 520 Headset... you'll be happier with others.7/28/2012", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Barely OK, but others from Plantronics are far better!", "unixReviewTime": 1343433600, "reviewTime": "07 28, 2012"}

I don't know whether the iPhone 4 assists in the overall performance or not, but it's great.  Audio quality followed by manufacture quality (in regards to durability, comfort and fit) are the features which most affects my satisfaction.This is a Bluetooth profile 2.0 device, by the way. I'm quite content with the product. I know my phone supports profile 2.1 but I use this as my work earpiece, so that I'm not tangled up in my chorded stereo headset while I'm trying to get in and out of my seatbelt.It feels durable, though I'm not going to put it through a drop test, if I can help it. What I hear through the headset is clearly audible with good tone. I have had no complaints from the other end about being heard, so that's wonderful.Plantronics' signature tones make ease of use standard fare; ascending on, descending off, high-pitch, low-pitch...all are fitting to their assignments. The voice-dial feature works fine. It can be paired to two devices, though I'm unsure if I would - maybe I'll try with my PS3 that I never use. It supports calling the previously dialed number. If I choose to, I can send a call over to voice mail through the device as well. It's got all the amenities.The power cord can be optionally placed in an included little charging dock. It was a fight fitting the double wire into the single wire pass-through, but I managed. When everything is properly put together, the charging dock works nicely and also keeps the headset's in-ear part up off the desk and in the air, which I tend to find conveniently sanitary.I'm not one to spend a hundred bucks on a couple bucks worth of anything, so for me this is an acceptable value. I've spent more on headsets in the past and then swore never to invest in another, but with work and necessity, here I go again.

I also find it useful for talking on the phone at home while also completing other tasks. The only drawback I have experienced is that I don't always get a secure fit, especially when I put the headset on quickly, but this may very well be due to the shape of my ears as my father doesn't seem to have this trouble.

I had a Plantronics bluetooth headset before (which I thought I lost; of course it turned up after I shelled out the money for this one), and I was impressed with the sound quality and ease of use of the first one. Of course that meant that when it came time to upgrade I kept it in the family and sprung for the 520. I am so glad that I did!I have used this with a Blackberry Curve 8900, three different HTC phones (Mytouch Slide, Mytouch Slide 3G, and I forget the name of the last one), and my current phone, a Samsung Galaxy S2, so I have quite a bit of cell phone manufacturer variety to conclude that this headset is amazing. That being said, the bulk of this review will be based upon my recent use with the Samsung Galaxy. I am fairly certain that the syncing process for this product is similar amongst all cell phones (regardless of carrier, brand, and cost), so when I cover that point, I am going to assume that other brands sync similar to all of my phones.Durability & ComfortThe Plantronics Voyager 520 (I'll abbreviate going forward to PV520) is a plastic device with a rubberized ear \"hoop\". The hoop itself is hinged and rotates 360 degrees, enabling the headset to be used on either ear.The PV520 is lightweight and comfortable to wear. The rubber piece of the headset which is inserted into the ear canal (not far) is soft and pliable, allowing it to \"mould\" to the shape of the canal. For someone like me (I have very narrow ear canals), this is a critical aspect to the design; most headsets that I have used which need to be inserted into the ear become uncomfortable after a short period of time. With the PV520, I have been able to wear the headset all day without any discomfort. Putting the device on is a bit weird at first, although you will quickly become acclimated. Over time, you will be a pro and be able to put the headset over your ear with one hand!In terms of durability, the headset is great. The lightweight feel may result in the user believing the product to be \"cheap\" - this is far from the truth. My headset receives all sorts of abuse, crammed into my pocket, pulled in and out of my hear, jostled around in my handbag, dropped; I am sure that you get the idea. There has been no reduction in the sound quality!After a year of use, the only issue that I have had with this headset involves the ear \"hoop\" (the part of the phone which goes over the back of your ear). A few months ago, the rubberized piece of the hoop came off of the plastic base it was attached to. It was a clean \"break\", I would imagine the glue used to hold it together had simply worn off. A little bit of superglue resolved the problem.Using the HeadsetThe design of the headset is sleek; surfaces are rounded (for comfort) and the silver stripe is somewhat stylish. The abuse I have inflicted upon the device resulted in the silver paint chipping, but I am not out to win a fashion show, so this is a minor issue. The flashing light (the headset will flash blue to indicate the Bluetooth is turned on (on your phone) and that any phone calls will have the audio routed through the PV520. The light will flash red and the headset will beep (again, not so that it can be heard without it being in your ear) to let you know that you have a low battery. If the light is off completely, either you have turned the device off or the battery is dead.The charger is a \"snap\" (think of a snap closure on clothing). This means quick attachment to the charging cable that can be accomplished blindfolded (if that is your sort of thing). The PV520 charges quickly and the battery life is roughly 7 hours of straight talking (I know this because I was once on a phone call for 7 hours... don't ask). If left off the charger, the power will hold for maybe 2 days, however; the battery will slowly drain after that point.As mentioned above, the headset itself is lightweight yet durable. The picture of the product shows the single button on the side. In addition to depressing the button straight down (like clicking a mouse), the button also toggles left and right. The toggle function is used to control the volume on the headset - the volume for your phone will still need to be adjusted separately.Using the headset is simple. All commands executed by the headset are accomplished from this button. After it has been synced to your phone, all that you need to do is press and hold the button to initiate voice command dialing. Adjusting the volume works well, with the button clicking when it is toggled to either side (left for louder, right for softer). After a year, the button has not worn out and still functions exactly as it did brand new. When you receive a phone call, the headset will play a jingle (not audible to anyone near you). This jingle will play even if your phone is set to vibrate/silence. To answer the call, simply click the button on the side of your headset; after a moment of silence, the call will proceed as normal.Setting Up the Device (Syncing)For all of my cell phones, the sync process was smooth and quick. The instructions included with the headset are clear and easily understood. After you have initiated the \"find device\" function from your phone (usually an option in the Settings menu, some phones have a specific Bluetooth option as most of mine did; if yours doesn't and you are unsure how to set your phone into the bluetooth seek mode, you may need to call your carrier's tech support), it is time to setup the headset for recognition. To sync your headset, hold down the button until it flashes red and blue quickly (roughly six seconds). If done correctly, the headset will be acknowledged by your phone and ready to go within seconds.Sound QualityThis headset is LOUD. It is by far one of the clearest bluetooth headset that I have ever used. In fact, in some instances, it can be too loud! My old Motorola headset was so quiet that I could not even hear anyone while I was driving. This is definitely not the case with the PV520. For 99% of the time, the microphone on the phone works excellently and the person that you speaking with will hear you clearly and with no trouble. The noise filtering on the headset also helps to clear out background noises (it makes them softer, not necessarily eliminating them completely), resulting in your voice being heard and not the motor of your car. For the other 1% of the time, sometimes you just need to turn off the headset and turn it back on. I do not know why that happens, but since it so rarely does I am not too concerned about the annoyance.OverallI recommend the Plantronics Voyager 520 quite enthusiastically. It does cost a bit more than some other models of Bluetooth headsets, however; the quality of this headset it worth it. After three years of vigorous use, I am happier than ever with my investment. With the optional vehicle charger, you can charge your headset on the way to your destination (great for long trips!), further amping up my praises for this phone (it may not seem like much, but it is VERY convenient once you are spoiled by it).In short, if you want a quality headset that more than performs, this is for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bluetooth, Use Mouthwash!", "unixReviewTime": 1364601600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2013"}

Prentice \"Splaktar\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I got these last week and I've tried them out on 2 different smartphones and 2 different computers. The sound quality for music is really good and I've been comfortable wearing them for multiple hours. Using them with many devices can be a bit of a pain because Bluetooth does not transition between devices very smoothly (takes a few extra steps - which result in missed calls and other inconveniences).I can walk around most of my small apartment and still hear the music. When I walk behind a wall, it usually gets staticy and cuts out until I am back within sight of the device. It seems unfortunate that I can't use them in the whole house since apartment isn't much more than 900 sq ft.The major reason that I bought these was to do high quality voice calls over Bluetooth. This has been hit-or-miss. Many times (especially when listening to music when the call arrives), the voice quality will be terrible and I will need to call the person back. The quality also suffers a lot when I am sync'ing the phone over Bluetooth and trying to make a voice call at the same time. But even when not syncing and not listening to music, just making a simple call and nothing else, the call quality will be bad (I hear static and the other side hears me \"like you are in a tunnel\" - reported by 3 different people).It seems like the phones (N75, EVO) may not have proper noise canceling like Skype or other VOIP products. So far I've had fairly good success with these over VOIP. Callers have not complained and I have not heard the static that I get on cell calls.So in the end, I'm happy to keep these and use them for listening to music and VOIP calling on my desktop. But I am unfortunately going to have to find another solution to use with my smartphone :(", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good for music, not for voice calls", "unixReviewTime": 1279324800, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2010"}

That's the lesson I learned from buying non-licensed Apple accessories (fortunately it was a cheap lesson).Committed to not paying the outrageous sum of 50 dollars for the Apple av cable (since I knew they could make them for less than $5), I started to look for the cheapest licensed cable. The Scosche fit the bill for about half of the Apple cable (although a lot more than the generic and without the charging feature of either). A compromise... yes, but I really like to be able to share photos and videos when on the road, and the ability to watch movies on the TV is nice too.With the iPod touch and this cable, you can: play movies, video podcasts, and photo slideshows.You can NOT with this and the iPod touch: display the current screen (I don't think any do), pick a single photo from the gallery (you need to start the show and go next... next... next... until you get there) and you can't play plain music (you could get a headphone to RCA adapter cheap though if that's what you wanted to do).I've since upgraded again to 3.1.1 and it still works. Overall I'd give it a 4 1/2 stars because I wish it would let me do the other things and was a bit cheaper, but it does the most important things well and is cheaper than most of the alternatives.UPDATE 08/2010-------------------------------------For what it's worth, the cable is still working great on the iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch with iOS 4.x, so compatibility shouldn't be a problem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works with OS 3 and 3.1.1", "unixReviewTime": 1253318400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2009"}

It connects your iphone/ipad/ipod to a video or audio device through an AV connection.  (I.e. one yellow cable for video and a red and white cable for left and right audio).  It has a micro-usb power input, so if you have a micro-usb cable, you can power your device while it's running video or audio.Within a week, I was no longer getting a reliable connection - I would have to wiggle the cable or carefully put things under the cable to raise it relative to the iphone, or wouldn't get output.  A few weeks after that, and I can't get a connection at all.  I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue, a design issue, or if the weight of the cable just degrades the connection after a while.  Maybe a dock would be a better choice.  If you buy this, I would recommend saving the packaging in case you need a return.Another word of caution: under the standard Apple operating system, not all applications support \"video out\" through the port at the bottom of the device.  For example, Netflix currently supports video out for the iphone 4 and ipad, but not for earlier iphones or for ipods.  So you can't take a factory spec device and expect to mirror the home screen or anything like that, but you can play the stuff that the Apple operating system wants you to play.I have a \"jailbroken\" iphone 3g running tvout2 mirror, a non istore app that mirrors all output to the cable.

It is a full color, unlocked GSM slider phone with a 5MP camera, stereo sound, music and video features. While it is a quad band world phone, here in the US it works on T-Moblie and AT&T; networks (although AT&T; is recommened for its faster 3G network). Let me start out by describing what you get. Nokia has packed quite a bit in the box. They include cables to hook your phone up to you TV to watch video, a car charger, a sync cable to sync your phone to your pc for updates, video, app and music downloads, battery, travel charger, a remote that hooks into the phone along with earbuds that hook into the remote, (no you can't use the earbuds without the remote and you cannot hook alternate headsets into the phone or the remote),an invitation to use the OVI service (an online backup service with tiered features to backup your phone), a User Guide, Get Started Guide, the Nokia PC Suite CD, an NGage free game offer, warranty info and of course the phone.Now for the phone. It is a beautiful, full color, lightweight device that promises much, but delivers less. Since this is a GSM phone, after calling to switch service, you only need to add your SIM card to start using it. The battery was partially charged out of the box, so it did not take long to charge. Despite what I have read from other reviews, I had no problems adding contacts from my SIM card to the phone. Since this phone IS NOT a touch screen, everything is menu driven. Nokia did not do a good job of letting you know where all the menus are. While a User Guide is included, the full version of how to use the phone is included in the online version of the guide that can be found at the Nokia product page. The buttons on this phone do not stand out as much as I would like. The call and end keys are on opposite sides, but are not as prominent as they should be. The Power key is on top and it takes a few minutes to turn it on. There are \"media keys\" that work for video or music playback that surround the larger scroll key. The scroll key is used to navigate the various menus, with the usual Nokia context sensitive Selection keys above the Call and End keys. The scroll key is very sensitive, I kept hitting selections that I did not want and it is also used for navigating web pages. There is a menu key that is usefull and a multimedia key which isn't that helpful. The display is beautiful and call quality is excellent. You slide the main section up to bring up the keyboard and number pad. This phone should have had a qwerty keyboard, as the typing on the keypad is time consuming pressing keys until you come to the one yo need.  This is also even more frustrating for the Internet. While the display is very clear, the browser is only a WAP mobile browser, not the full Internet browser that an iPhone or iPod Touch would have. Using the scroll key to move a too small arrow around is a pain. While this phone offers YouTube, the Internet video quality is very spotty. The stereo sound in 3D is very clear and you do not need a headset to listen. This phone is one of the few compatible with the Amazon UnBox service. To try out the service, I installed the Nokia PC suite. It installled a software updater, Video suite manager, photo app, PC suite app, and a Map loader for the GPS function. The installation of the apps was fast, though starting the PC Suite app took a very long time. The Amazon UnBox service is a video on demand portable player to watch video on you PC or mobile device. It was very easy to download the player and install it. Amazon has a nice selection of videos and I downloaded a Stargate SG-1 episode to view on my phone. Purchasing was fast and easy although downloading took a very long time because of the extra option for portable files. The UnBox player interface is nice, but I had a difficult time trying to transfer the files to the phone. The help files say that you can just copy files to the phone, but you actually transfer the files by clicking play. After finally getting the files to transfer to the phone, I was able to watch the video. The video playback on the phone for the Amazon purchase was clear and of excellent quality. Playback on the phone is in the widescreen format. It will play in both portrait and landscape mode, although queing up takes a while unlike an iPod or iPhone. You can slide the main phone the other way to show the video keys in landscape mode. The main 5MP camera with the Carl Zeiss lens is outstanding, the best camera I have seen on a phone so far. It has a flash and is located on the back. There is also a lower resolution camera on the front. Both can capture images and video. Photos look fantastic. The N96 is also supposed to broadcast TV signals through the LIVE TV service, but like most of the Nokia service options, it is not available in the US. Neither is the Nokia Music Store and the Nokia Maps turn by turn service. The phone will play music via the Windows Media Player (no Apple iTunes formats) and podcasts. It also has an FM radio and Internet radio playback capability. The radio feature will only play with the remote and headset attached. You cannot listen to the radio without the attachments, another boneheaded manuever by Nokia. The Maps feature, which is the GPS function to me was useless. After the app opens, you see a 3D image of the planet. You have to install the Maps software before the actual street level option will work and as I mentioned before, the turn by turn doesn't work in the US. My iPod Touch handles GPS faster and easier than this. The N96 is also supposed to be Bluetooth compatible, but I could not get it to discover my Bluetooth headset despite numerous attempts.This phone has a lot of quirks. While it does turn on fairly quickly and you can make calls quickly, Using many of the features means responding to a number of silly requests such as \"go on Internet now?\" after selecting the web option. I personally prefer touch screen phones because it is much easier to navigate than having to drill down through numerous menus. Some shortcut options are available, but not for a lot of features. I did not try the OVI service, since I already use a wonderful service called Dashwire to backup my phone. The N96 does have a large 16 GB storage with a memory card addition available, it does leave a lot to be desired. This phone is better engineered for the overseas market rather than the US. It would a good option for those who use the Windows Media audio files for music and radio and camera and video fans.

Call quality is good, and the speakerphone is loud.For productivity the phone has a robust phonebook and calendar.  Moreover, the phonebook allows for endless customization of the information contained in a contact.  There are programs to open Microsoft Office documents and PDF files.  The phone can also access POP3 e-mail, and be set to download new messages automatically.For entertainment there is a video player, FM radio, and an MP3 player.  The video works well with Amazon's Unbox Video on Demand service.  You can download special smaller files just for use on the phone, and it's easy to transfer them over using Amazon's free software download.  The music player is nicely featured, sounds good, and has a 3.5mm headphone jack making it easy to use your favorite headphones.The HTML web browser lets you view web pages like you would on a computer.  (I downloaded Skyfire, a free browser, as an alternate because sometimes the standard browser does not display pages well). N-Gage is for playing and downloading games, and Nokia maps comes pre-loaded with US maps and three months of turn-by-turn directions free.  Additionally, the GPS receiver locks onto a signal quickly.Being a Nokia N-Series the built in camera is 5 megapixels, with a dual LED flash, and autofocus with an assist light.

Video can be recorded at 640 x 480 at 30fps, much higher quality than most phones.To store your files there's a huge 16GBs of built in memory, as well as a Micro SD slot for more space when needed.The \"profiles\" feature allows you to set different ringer volumes and tones for different occasions, and you can time them so it reverts to the standard profile.  This is a great feature as it allows me to set my phone to work mode and it automatically switches back to normal mode at 5:30 when I leave.  Additionally, you can have the N96 say the callers name when it rings.  The \"destinations\" feature lets you select access points for Internet usage.  Since I have pay per use with AT&T;, I removed AT&T; from the list so I never have to worry about unexpected charges, and I added my home and work Wi-Fi so it automatically connects to them.I have not used the software that came with the phone since it does not work with Macs.  However, I downloaded a plug-in from Nokia's website that allows me to sync with my Mac over Bluetooth using the Mac's iSync, and it works great.Battery life is about 4 days with moderate use (a few calls, some texting, and web browsing).Now for the negatives: 1) The biggest problem, by far, is that sometimes the phone does not ring with the ringer I picked, it reverts to the default Nokia tune after one ring.  I called Nokia about it twice, and tried their suggestions, but it still happened.  They told me to send the phone to them for repair.  I declined and decided to live with it.  I also reset the phone to no avail.  2) The phone can sometimes be slow in operation.  Specifically, when opening the camera and browsing the photo gallery.  3) The dual LED flash is not very effective, you have to be right on top of the subject, and the pictures come out bluish.  Additionally, there is no sliding cover for the lens, and the camera button is stiff and hard to press.  4) For the price, the materials should be of higher quality, it's constructed of average feeling plastics.  5) The included owners manual is skimpy and barely covers all the phones features.  6) The battery depletes very quickly after 3 bars are left.(Sorry for the long review, but it's a very complex phone.)All in all... a feature packed mini computer that happens to be a phone, it lives up to the Nokia N Series tradition.01/15/09 Update: The phone has been reseting sometimes when I get a call and it has not been working well with my Acura's bluetooth HandsFreeLink I can only make calls by dialing on the phone then transferring it over.  If I could, I would take a star away.01/27/09 Update: I got a new SIM card (mine was 2 years old) and just downloaded the new software version 12.043 and the phone runs faster and the ringer and reset issues seem to be fixed.  So I'd give it a star back.03/24/09 Update: Phone still working well, slider still nice and tight and locks into position nicely.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Powerful, But Quirky, Smart Phone.", "unixReviewTime": 1231459200, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2009"}

{"reviewerID": "A2SH6A32BE6NEV", "asin": "B001DN5030", "reviewerName": "Comp Expert \"Comp\"", "helpful": [5, 7], "reviewText": "SummaryThe Nokia N96 is an expensive phone that competes against many rival companies that have done their homework over the years to provide competitive products against this phone-dominating firm. The N96 fails to be able to be a leader in its phone class, with issues that are problematic of a phone years older.  The few positives of the N96 do not command the high purchase price.Background:I used the N96 with AT&T; service in the US.  My local areas has extensive 3G coverage so I was always able to get a solid 3G, fast, connection (Note I do not have any LiveTV service in my area).  My normal phones I use are the Iphone 3G and the Samsung Blackjack II (windows mobile).  I am a rather geeky person who enjoys tinkering with phones and computers so I will provide an assessment from a user-experience in comparison to the two phones I've cited, which I use often on the same 3G service; for those who aren't aware, GSM phones have sim cards that can be popped into different phones so aren't \"tied\" to a specific piece of hardware (i.e. Verizon, Sprint).Unboxing:The N96 comes in a very nice retail box.  This is typical of Nokia's products, placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging.  It sets off a nice first impression of the product.Build:Overall the phone has a mirrored surface for its LCD and a shiny black glossy surface for the rest of the phone.  The black does attract fingerprints and at first this tends to put people off.  However, after a while the fingerprint effect psychologically diminishes upon itself so you do not really care.The keys are only average in tactile feel and comparable to a regular $200 phone.  This is surprising since I thought a top of the line phone would have quality keys with a firm solid response.  Not so here.  The keys spacing are not conducive to one-hand dialing without looking at the unit.The LCD is beautiful, with crisp text and accurate color display. If there's anything that's very well engineered on this phone it will be the LCD and camera (more on that below).  Truly world-class, I haven't quite seen an LCD look as good as on this phone.The camera is really good on this phone. Quite a far cry from the iphone and other Windows mobile phones.  Pictures come out reasonably sharp in daylight.  Low light is poor, but again, that's nothing unusual from any camera phone and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone. The camera does have a very bright LED that can amazingly light up a dead-dark environment a few feet ahead at max range.The exterior speaker is loud enough but only average in quality with a slightly tinny output.  I believe that my blackjack II's speaker is louder and cleaner in output, not significantly so, but enough to be noticeable.The rear kickstand, a widely marketed feature, is a pure gimmick that is poorly designed. Because it is not directly in the middle of the unit, the weight is not properly balanced. This means that an uneven surface, or a slight breeze could topple the unit over.  Tacky, I was so full of disgust when I tried it myself.  Needs to be completely reengineered or gotten rid of entirely.The ports are that of a micro USB, headphone, and power port. Nokia has decided not to use the USB port for power, however, so you have to lug around the power plug during travel if you take your laptop with you.  Not cool!There are no rubber boots for the ports on the phone.  Not a good sign - -water seepage can end up being a problem here.  And for those who say those boots tear off anyway, that is not necessarily true.  My old Blackjack II phone never had any of its boots torn off even though I heavily \"abused\" it for a year by inserting an removing countless times.Battery life is mediocre.  I could get about a day's worth of use with heavy web browsing and a few phone calls.  The battery gets much hotter than a normal smartphone does when in heavy discharge/charge mode.  It would be nice if Nokia could address this issue by producing a phone that doesn't feel like a mini hot plate to your face or hand.Accessories:The included car charger is a strange size.  It could not fit into my cig lighter.  Fortunately, I had a car charger from a different Nokia model that was compatible.  There is a proper USB cable included, which is a good thing since not everyone has a microUSB ported type of cable.  The travel charger is small enough.  There is no MicroSD card included, but these are cheap enough to buy for anyone who needs more than the regular 16GB of built in memory.  It's really nice that the memory is expandable like this, compared to the iphone where you are locked out from expansion options.  For music lovers, this means you can have a max of 24GB of memory and 16GB microsd's are on there way over soon, so that would mean 32gb of storage.  Not bad!Interface and response:The user interface is typical Nokia sybian.  That is, the menu set is fairly straight forward in operation.  The phone, however, has a sluggish feel to it.  Programs load sluggishly, making you wonder if you pressed the right button to launch it.  After a bit, the lag finally catches up.  I expect such typical behavior from a Windows Mobile phone,but the fact a Symbian phone does this is clearly unacceptable.  I'm not sure why the phone is so slow in execution; supposedly this phone lacks a multimedia processor and is clocked very low.  Regardless, it simply is slow, and that's all that matters to the end-user who will feel upset waiting at the response times.  This issue likely extends into the browser.The built-in web browser is much better than IE for windows mobile.  However, it is much worse than the Iphone's browser.  Pages render fairly well but loading is slow and scrolling stutters.  Although the phone was capable of launching youtube videos from the regular youtube site, there was so much stuttering going on that it was useless. Resource intensive sites like CNN are too slow to load, making it painful to view.  Zooming was horrible and nonintuitive. Again, this was a common issue on old phones from the early 2000s, but a top of the line phone for 2009?  The Iphone, by comparison, breezes through the most intense sites with ease.  This is sadly not a good web browsing phone. Since a 3G data plan with AT&T; is so expensive, some of us would like a phone that's capable of browsing like an Iphone does.  Can't do that here.The phone does not support an international character set out of the box.  If you want to to view Chinese, for example, you cannot do this unless you mail in your phone to a Nokia service center.  This is a ludicrous option (did we timewarp to 1999?) in a time when extras should be downloadable from the manufacturer, even for a fee.  Since there's only one Nokia service center in the entire USA, you have to wait a long time for the turnaround.  To go without a phone that long is unacceptable.  The Iphone, by comparison, supports International characters right out of the box!The java stack on the N96 is awful.  It's too sensitive to security prohibitions and runs sluggishly, again.  I tried running Opera Mini, a java app, and it kept giving me security warnings every time I launched it, with no way to bypass those warnings.  The Opera mini program ran much slower than on my Blackjack II, a reflection, again, on the slow processing speed of the N96.The included GPS program was incredibly slow (do I hear an echo?) compared to the free Google Maps I've used on the iphone and the Blackjack.  Scrolling just to browse a map was painful and not something I could have any fun with.  In contrast, I love being able to just browse the maps on my other phones because it's quick and efficient.The N96 does have an auto position that uses the accelerometer.  It does work (disabled by default) but not all Symbian programs support it.  Therefore you are left with a rather quirky feature that may not activate when you expect it to.The T9 system is fast and pretty accurate. Honestly it's not going to get any better than this for input with a numeric keypad. The next step is have some hard alpha keys or an onscreen keyboard.As for phone quality, it sounded pretty good on both ends. Then again ,a 3G connection provides the crisp quality so the network infrastructure is more to the reason here.Conclusion:Nokia's N96 feels like a step back into time. It is sluggish in response, has poor included utilities, and its construction is not as good compared to its main rivals -- The iphone and the various Windows mobile platform phones.  The high price is not commensurate with its ability.  In particular, web browsing is awful.  A complete redesign is needed to make this phone faster and more intuitive.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Needs to be a better phone for its high price", "unixReviewTime": 1231977600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2009"}

Diskin", "helpful": [85, 94], "reviewText": "I was extremely excited to open up the Nokia N96, because from its specs it looked to be one of the most powerful mobile phones on the market.  It certainly lived up to its expectations in some areas, and exceeds them in others, but fell short with some very common issues.For anyone looking for a camera/media device that also does phone calls, this might have been a serious contender.The media player works well for audio, the built-in FM tuner is great, and the internet radio feed was easy to use and loaded with content.  This phone does everything well, but not nearly well enough to justify its astronomical price tag.------------------Things Done Right:Browser - The browser on the phone rendered the pages I tried perfectly and it was very easy to navigate using the device.  Bookmarks and other features you'd want were all there.FM Radio - This worked like a charm!  It was very cool to have this in a mobile device.Light Weight - The phone weighs considerably less than my AT&T; Fuze and Tilt.Massive Storage - The phone's best feature is its internal 16 GB of storage.Looks - Trust me when I say the phone looks even better in person.---------------Half-Way There:Mapping - Rather than relying on a live internet feed for maps, it had very detailed maps of the US right on the phone.  This is great if you are in an area with patchy service and need directions.  But, it's no Google Maps.  I've been spoiled by having Google Maps on my Windows Mobile phones for some time now, and while the mapping application on this phone is good, it's not Google Maps.  Plus, many of the advanced features of this application require an extra fee such as turn-by-turn directions and traffic reports.WiFi - Connecting the phone to my home wireless network with WPA/PSK was a breeze.  HOWEVER, many of the features  on the phone such as the mapping tool, internet radio, and others required use of data plan, even if you were connected via WiFi.  And despite trying, I could never get it to connect to my computer for WiFi Sharing.Help - The phone has online help for nearly every menu, most of which was well-written and useful.  Some of the more rare settings had no help, however.Camera - While this phone won't replace your $200 digital camera, it's better than what I've seen on most mobile phones.  I especially liked the on-screen menus for making adjustments on the fly.  The flash on the back of the camera is great for close-up subjects.Voice Command - There is a utility which reads you your messages to you, which was pretty neat.  And, you can dial your contacts through voice command, plus launch applications.  Unfortunately, that's all.  Voice command apps on other devices allow you to dial numbers as they are spoken, play specific media, or dictate text messages.-----------------More Work Needed:No Keyboard - This device lacks both a keyboard and touch screen, limiting all input to the numeric pad and a plethora of other buttons.  If you are a heavy text/emailer, this is going to be a deal-breaker for you.IM Difficult - The phone includes an IM application, but it was intimidating to configure with settings that I had no clue about.  Other phones include apps which are preconfigured for Yahoo, AIM, and MSN, but that was not the case here.  The manual and help were useless here.Micro USB - Every portable device I own uses Mini USB for sync and charging, but the Nokia N96 introduces the even smaller Micro USB.  That means that I need to carry yet another cable.No USB Charge - To make it worse, you cannot charge via USB.  While the phone comes with an AC charger and a car charger, its proprietary and means yet ANOTHER cable to carry.WMV Playback - Despite being touted as a media player, the phone would not play any of the WMV files I copied to it.  These were non-DRM files that worked fine on other phones.AGPS - The manual claims that the phone supports Assisted GPS (to speed up your positioning) but it would not work.Other Annoyances - There were a few other things that bothered me about the phone.  For instance, the music playback stuttered while using the phone for text messaging or mapping, and there was no option to disable the power-saving features while on AC power.--------------In Conclusion:For the price that this phone sells for, and comparing it to other devices on the market at half the price, I find it very hard to justify recommending the phone to anyone.Its only real saving grace is the 16 GB of storage, although some of its competitors will support memory cards with 4-16 GB of capacity.If the price came down considerably, and they issued a software upgrade to fix several of the above issues, it would probably beat its competitors hands-down.  But until then, I recommend passing this phone up for any of its half-priced competitors.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Specs, Too Many Short-Comings, Way Too Pricey", "unixReviewTime": 1230681600, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2008"}

If you are looking for a work-friendly phone, keep then perhaps theNokia E90 Communicator Unlocked Smartphone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Red)would be a better (and more expensive) choice.Also, if you do buy this phone, make sure you buy a case/holster and a screen protector, as well.----------------------------------------------The Details...I had a hard time deciding on a star-rating for this phone because it is quite different from any other smartphone that I have used.  In the last couple of years, I have used:Blackberry 8300Helio OceanAT&T; 8525Samsung SCH-i760  (my current phone)With the exception of the Helio Ocean, the Blackberry, AT&T; and Samsung are business-centric phones.  All four feature a Qwerty keyboard.  The Helio, AT&T; and Samsung each have their own numeric keypad in addition to the qwerty keyboard.All except for the Helio, did business applications, email, telephone communication, and syncing with easily -- that's what they were designed to do and that is the frame of reference that I am coming from.The Nokia N96, to me, isn't really aimed at the business centric crowd.  It is aimed at the multimedia \"I want to be entertained\" crowd (and a rich crowd, that must be judging by the price tag).Sure, the Nokia does email and \"office stuff\" ok -- but because they decided not to include the qwerty keyboard and opted to include so much multimedia stuff, it is clear that they decided \"work can wait\".  Not necessarily a BAD thing... just different than I'm used to.So let's talk about what the Nokia IS designed for: talking, listening to music, taking pictures/video, and watching video.First, initial impressions about aesthetics:-- it is actually smaller than I'm used to (the Samsung).  It is lighter, shorter, and thinner.  You open the box and you certainly experience that \"WOW\" factor -- this phone is elegant and sophisticated.  The finish is the shiny \"piano finish\" that is so common.  Frankly, I HATE that because the moment you touch it, it is smudgy and that just drives me crazy.  The sides are metal but the back is a flimsy plastic and overall it just doesn't feel as solid as the other phones which were mostly metal cases.The screen is unbelievably gorgeous and bright.  No other smartphone I have used can hold a candle to it (I have not seen an iPhone so don't really have a basis of comparison there).The first thing I did was call someone.  Call quality is excellent -- also much better than any other cell phone I have used.  Very very close to Landline quality.  I paired it with aNokia 02705X6 BH-503 Bluetooth Stereo Headsetand sound quality (both receiving and talking better than most phones.  One of the things that is good about the call quality is the ability to really turn up the volume.  With other phones, I could seldom get the volume loud enough to hear over road/wind noise in the car.  With the N96, you actually have to turn it down because it can get uncomfortably loud.Even using the speaker phone is very good.  The N96 has \"stereo speakers\" and while you aren't going to throw out your home theater system, the speakers make the phone even better.Camera------The N96 has a 5 mp Carl Zeiss camera built in.  The camera can take stills or video at 30 frames per second.  I really like the camera because it allows me to be more spontaneous with taking pictures/video.  With my Samsung, the only time I used the cell phone feature was when I wrecked my car and wanted pictures of the evidence.  With Carl Zeiss optics (Zeiss is known for making the best optics in the world), you can take very solid photo album quality pictures with this camera.  It isn't going to replace your 12 MP SLR but for \"on-the-go\" pictures that you wouldn't otherwise catch, it is really nice to have.Music-----Again, the music quality on this device rivals any MP3 player.  I actually used it with a set of high-end Denon cans today and it was almost as good playing the CD through a PC.  I say \"almost\" because I was able to pick up some crackly artifact that resulted from the Nokia converting my higher bit-rate recordings to a lower bit-rate for space considerations.  But this trade off is worth it.  With 16 GB of main memory, I have over 3 hours of music loaded on the phone with space to spare.Keypad and controls:--------------------I'm still not sold on the T9 only keyboard.  I read a previous commenter about how you can learn to type faster with T9 than Qwerty and I intend to try it.  I do have to say that T9 typing seems to work better than I remembered it on previous phones.I'm not wild about the feel of the buttons.  They are all flat and do not feel \"solid\" to me.  I could see them cracking with a lot of use.Web and email-------------Even though this is a smaller device, the screen is actually larger than my Samsung.  You wouldn't think a couple of pixels in either direction would be that big a deal but it really helps with page display.Video-----I believe the N96 was designed around this feature.  Downloading videos from Amazon was very easy and the playback is just like a tiny TV.  To me, though, this is the least \"useful\" feature of the phone.  If I'm sitting around and have some time to kill, I'm more likely to check email, listen to music or just plain read.Battery life-------------Average battery life.  I was able to use the cell phone for about 1.25 hours of talk time and 3 hours of listening to music before the battery died.  That means if you use your phone a lot, you'll need to keep it plugged in (fortunately, the phone comes with both an AC charger and a car charger -- very unusual in this day and age).Syncing with your PC--------------------Included with the phone is a software suite that will allow you to sync with Outlook etc.  Installation took awhile (I had to download .NET) but getting all my contact data onto the device was a snap.  Transferring music wasn't great -- it could be that I just don't have the sync settings set up correctly.  However, the N96 requires Windows Media Player 11 for the syncing.  I have A LOT of music loaded in WMP and didn't want to load EVERYTHING on.  I tried to create a playlist to identify just what I wanted transferred over.  Unfortunately, it still grabbed more than I wanted it to.Miscellaneous--------------- The USB cable that comes with it is not your standard USB cable -- at least on the end that connects to the phone.  It has a smaller connector than most devices (like MP3 players, external disk drives, my other cell phones, etc.  So if you want to sync up at home and at work, you'll have to hang on tight to this cable (or buy another one online).-- The Nokia does provide both a car and standard AC charger which is good since you will need to keep this thing constantly plugged in.  There is no way to accommodate an extended battery at this point -- it would require a new \"back plate\" (this is the approach that AT&T; adopted for their 8525).  Hopefully, this will be something Nokia will provide down the road.  However, I will say that this device provides a LOT of options to tweak the features to maximize battery performance.  For example, you can specify during what hours to go fetch email.  There's not much point in fetching email 24/7 when you may only want access to it 12x5.  You can also set it up to shut down during night hours etc.-- The screen is not a touch screen.  Also, if you want to protect it, you're probably going to want to get a HTC Touch Diamond JAVOScreen (Ultra-Clear) + JAVOedge MetaCharger Bundle (Euro) screen protector to hide the finger prints and prevent scratches.  I had one left over from my 8525 and it isn't a perfect fit but works good enough.-- You will also want to invest in a good case/holster.  I can't believe that Nokia is selling a 700.00 phone with a screen like this and yet they don't even provide the most basic protection required.  Even the bluetooth headphones came with their own carrying pouch.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not for hardcore business types -- otherwise very cool.", "unixReviewTime": 1230681600, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2008"}

This Nokia N96 is sort of a compromise between the two.  It has the strengths of a smart phone while also delivering the pluses of the normal phone.  There are many pluses and minuses already mentioned by other reviewers, so I will not repeat the obvious ones.  Here are a few that really caught my attention:The Nokia Software loads about 700mb of software on your computer which would be fine if it all worked like it was intended.  I spent a lot of time searching forums for help on connecting and updating the device with the software.The 5mp camera is fantastic!  I also like the small camera on the front of the device.  Nice touch.  Though, this device is loaded with so many features and options, it could be overwhelming to the technically challenged.The TV out capability is excellent.  Home videos show clearly on my flat screen and movies display very well.  It's like the Swiss Army Knife of cell phones!I love the FM radio feature.  A good option that should be added to more portable devices.The phone is about the size of my LG Dare, but just a bit thicker.  It fits in your hand quite well.  Calls are clear.  A full querty keyboard would be a welcome addition, though.I use the device on T-Mobile (non 3G).  It works quite well, though you do give up certain features.The 2.8 inch screen is an absolute delight.  Crisp and clear.  Excellent for playing games and watching video.The N96, to me, is more of a designer gadget.  Those that love high tech devices with lots of features will drool over this phone.  It does everything pretty well, but compared with other phones, it doesn't really excel at anything.  It's definitely not the IPhone killer, but more of a trendy substitute. There are a lot of great phone choices out there.  The Nokia N96 would not be my first choice if my choice was utility (LG Dare).  Nor would it be my first choice for a smartphone (Blackberry or Samsung Omnia).

A 16 gig phone geared for music and video looked right up my alley. Having used this phone for several days and tried as many features as possible, I'm not nearly as enamored with it as I hoped. For a $600 phone, I expected something far more polished. This seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems. Let's run down the good stuff first.PROS:- Light, compact form factor. Considerably lighter than my Tilt.- 16 gig of memory. Excellent amount of included space, and can take a microSD card for even more media files.- Beautiful screen. Video is sharp and colorful, although it could be a bit brighter. But hard to complain with the quality of the picture. See below though for more comments on video playback. It also is much more visible in sunlight than my Tilt is.- 5 gig camera with flash and video capability. I debated whether to include this under the \"pros\" as I didn't find the quality of the images produced by the camera all that great, particularly indoors. But having a flash and being able to record video with it is still at least better than not having it at all.- Excellent sound quality and nice loud speakers. Includes two speakers for \"sort-of\" stereo playback. This phone can really produce some serious volume, I was quite impressed. Granted, the sound quality out of the speakers is not going to blow anyone away. But it's pretty good regardless. And make sure you turn the volume down before using the headphones, it will totally blast you away! If you regularly try to listen to music in noisy situations where volume is crucial, you will know how important this can be.- Excellent multimedia features included. FM radio, internet radio, podcasts, etc. Most of these I could do on my WM phone, but great to have them included for seamless integration right on the phone.- Good included accessories. Includes a remote with speakerphone, car charger, TV out cables, free game, etc. Better package overall than most phones.Now for my fairly long list of negatives.CONS:- Lack of fullsize keyboard and/or touchscreen. I was surprised to see there was no touchscreen on this phone, that makes it really hard to compete with other smartphones in the same class like the iPhone and any Windows Mobile phone. With my Tilt, I not only have a full QWERTY keyboard (which granted, is not the greatest way to enter text for most people, but nice for things like passwords and WEP keys) you can use a wide variety of entry methods that work with the touchscreen. I personally use ones like Fitaly and Touchpad which can give good speed and yet still easily handle non-standard text at any time. One of the things I particularly find annoying with phones like this that use T9 is that you often have to turn it on and off which requires going to the menu. Likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers, you have to constantly switch back and forth, which takes far longer on this phone than just about any other smartphone I've used. It's incredibly tedious and if you use your phone as a PDA or anything other than quick texting, you should probably look at better options.- Problems using Wifi versus AT&T; data plans. I personally use pay-as-you-go currently as I don't need to pay for monthly cell phone service and almost always have access to Wifi networks. With my Tilt, it's a simple matter of a one-time configuration of the phone for any Wifi network and it will use that automatically versus accessing the AT&T; data network. This phone just would not cooperate with that. It often would switch over and use the data plan and charge me no matter how I configured it, even going into the settings and making my Wifi the default. Worse, you would have to do this *every* time you access a new Wifi network, setting it up as a default and then switching it back, and even then, it seems to randomly hit the data network and charge me for usage without warning. And to make it even more annoying, just about every time it needs to access the internet, it has to ask me what network to use, the Wifi or AT&T.; Why bother setting a default (and configuring it for automatic) if it's not going to just use it?? It's almost like the phone is trying to get you to use the paid data plan whether you have access to Wifi or not. Just about everything else on this phone I can kind of deal with, or work around, but this is so frustrating for me and COSTS ME MONEY that it's a total dealbreaker. So if you want to use Wifi as your primary data access network, and not pay the significant cost of a monthly data plan, you will probably want to use a different phone.- Bare-bones email and web applications. The email and web apps that came with the phone didn't do much for me. Emails with HTML were not properly formatted at all, and the options for handling email as well were very limited compared to what I am used to. When I tried to adjust my settings, it wiped out my custom POP settings and I had to enter them all over again (which due to the lack of keyboard is particularly annoying). The web browser was not quite as bad, but navigating the pages without a touchscreen is slow and tedious and it kept popping up the \"overall\" page view when it was inconvenient. The back button brings up little thumbnails of the pages but for some reason they were often blank and kept skipping the actual page I wanted to get back to. I was easily able to load on the free Opera Mini browser however, which gave me a far better experience. If you use a smartphone, I highly recommend grabbing a copy of it. I've not yet found a free email replacement, I'd probably have to pay to get an email application that just does the basics that I would have liked to come with the device.- While there's certainly plenty of games on Symbian and for N-Gage, the library of applications is a bit more limited. Also just the fact that it doesn't use a touchscreen makes game play often more limiting and somewhat more tedious as it relies totally on keystrokes, particularly the types of games I prefer (card games, adventure games, etc.) Still, the games offered were decent enough and the graphics top-notch for a mobile phone, and I do notice more places offering Symbian versions of their software. Both my Hava player and Roboform mobile apps had versions that ran okay on the N96 (although not flawless).- Performance issues. My main hope was that this device would be zippier and less prone to locking up than the Tilt. Unfortunately this was not the case. The processor is downgraded from the previous N95 model, most likely done to allow them to also downgrade the battery as well but I can't say if the problems I saw are a result of this or typical for Symbian phones. While the video was sharp and beautiful to look at, I still experienced pauses and skips...particularly with the sample videos included! Almost all of the ones included with the phone did not play smoothly all the way through. I had better luck with some small videos that I synced to the device and a couple TV episodes that I downloaded from Amazon Unbox. While they did not always play perfectly, they were at least watchable for 95% of the time. The phone itself also often temporarily pauses and/or freezes and a few times locked up on me completely. Unlike the Tilt which has a reset option, I could not figure out how to unlock this phone when it froze other than to remove the back and pull the battery out. Very annoying.- Camera image quality. It's important when evaluating cameras to realize that megapixels means little about quality. So getting 5 MP with the phone means mostly that the images it takes will just take up more space on the phone. They certainly aren't of a quality that I would be interested in printing them out which is where the 5 MP would be of any use. They are of similar quality to most cellphones...which means only good for snapshots when you have nothing better on-hand. And indoors in anything other than very bright light, they were definitely worse than what my Tilt is able to take, even though the camera includes a flash.- Battery life. Barely passable, no better than my Tilt which was equally a battery hog. You definitely need to charge it every night and if you use your phone much, you may find you need to charge it during the day as well.- Voice control. This is one of those phones that you don't really train, it just recognizes the names you speak and picks the default phone. Also some basic application control. This type of VR can be problematic if you have people with similar names and I just much prefer training my own names and commands as I can with the software on WM phones. And of course, there's nothing in the manual about how to even use this feature.- Live TV. Touted as a feature, but won't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now. You're probably much better off just getting a Slingbox or Hava which will work with a wide range of phones these days, including this one.- Non-standard USB cable. May seem like a small nit, but things like this just annoy me. Why not use a standard mini-USB cable, which most people have multiple ones of, and also a USB cable that will simultaneous charge the device? It's really annoying when you are syncing the device, moving videos, etc. and it runs out of juice. Using this new micro USB cable means I'll need to buy another one for travel....and probably another cable for charging in different places.- GPS. I only tested the GPS briefly as this was another area where it seemed to insist on using the data plan rather than Wifi. But I just don't see the benefit in using a GPS on such a small screen and paying monthly fees for it, when you can buy dedicated GPS units for as little as $100 these days that are larger and easier to read while driving, and with much better features. This GPS didn't work nearly as well as my simple Garmin unit and didn't even compare with running TomTom on my Tilt which I don't pay any fee to use (other than the purchase cost of the software).- No case or screen protector. For the price, some kind of cheap case would be nice. The device comes with a plastic skin covering the front and back that would do nicely as a screen protector, but for some reason, they plastered a big \"NOKIA\" over the front so it can't be used. The screen and phone itself really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty readily so a screen protector would have been highly appreciated.- Nokia PC Suite issues. I didn't have too much trouble syncing my Outlook contacts, but had various issues with other parts of the PC Suite. Forget using the music application, for some reason it didn't read 99% of the tags in my MP3s, so had to use Media Player to sync music to the device. The video manager as well did not work very well for me. It handled small videos okay, but as soon as it got to anything with length, it locked up on me. Took me several tries to convert videos of more than 100 meg in size. I want to try and do some conversions myself and see what videos it really can handle, as I have other mobile video conversion software that does a good job, but I know already it doesn't seem to handle Divx video which is a shame.- Bare bones user manual. The manuals included cover the basics, but you won't find much help in them if you need more than just \"getting started\" information. For instance, I was trying to figure out where I turn on T9 predictive text, but there's absolutely no information in the manual on text entry whatsoever. I went to the Nokia site to see if the support section had a better manual to download, but nope. You better be good at figuring stuff out on your own to use this phone (and yes, I did figure out where the T9 setting was).- Other issues. I seem to just run into random problems with this phone. YouTube videos for instance would not play at all, regardless of which browser I used. It doesn't seem to like most of my album art in the music player, and does not always play smoothly if playing in the background while doing other activities on the phone (web browsing for instance). The microSD slot is harder than most to get the card in and out of. The build quality is very plastic, cheap feeling. And there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market. For instance, there's a settings screen for a \"scroll wheel\" even though the phone doesn't even have one! Would be nice if it did, but to have settings in there for something that does not even exist on it, makes me wonder how much testing they really gave this phone before releasing.To summarize, this is a phone I really wanted to like. It's got huge potential as a portable media device and phone, but there are just too many problem areas to recommend it over other devices in the same price range.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Some decent features, but too many issues to recommend", "unixReviewTime": 1230768000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2009"}

Here's the \"short\" version of my review.Switching to the Nokia N96 after using an HTC MDA with Windows Mobile on it for 2 1/2 years.If you slide the keypad down, the numeric keypad shows and the display remains in portrait.  If you slide the keypad up, the multimedia keypad shows and the display goes to landscape mode.  However, if you close the multimedia keypad, the display stays in landscape mode.  This can be a pro or a con, depending on who you are.  For me, this is a con, because I have to move the numeric keypad down to get the screen to go back to portrait.The menu items on the screen are customizable.CallsThe clearest calls ever.  This is the first mobile phone that I have ever used speakerphone where the other party does not ask, \"Are you on a speakerphone?\"  It sounds the same as if you were using the handset.  I did try using the \"Say Caller's Name\" function, hoping that the caller's name would be verbally communicated, but the phone froze up and had to be reset after a test call was made to it.MessagingMessages show the sender and the first 30 characters of any message, great for getting the jist of what you're looking for in your inbox.  The left and right buttons allow movement between Inbox, Templates, Drafts, Sent, Outbox and Reports.  Inbound MMS may take hours if being sent from a competitor's service company (this may be an AT&T; issue, though).CalendarLarge, easy to read month and week calendar.  Easy to add appointments, just pick a date and start typing.  Easily swap between calendar views using the * key.NetworkQuickly locates surrounding Wifi, however, once you select a network (even if the connection is unsuccessful) you must manually select a new network by vising the WLAN Scanning setting.ProfilesPhone has Normal, Silent, Meeting, Outdoor, Pager, and Offline profiles which are 100% customizable.  Press and hold the # key and you swap between your preferred profile and silent mode.  Excellent 1 click capability.BluetoothI did not test this feature extensively, but was able to connect to a BlackBerry Pearl quickly.Video CenterVideo starts in portrait, must open multimedia buttons to change to landscape.  Has extremely vivid, detailed video.  Multimedia backlit buttons on keyboard fade after so many seconds of being idle, must memorize which buttons are where.  Thankfully, the \"select\" button doubles as a pause button.PhotosYou can sort your photos by captured, months, albums, tags, downloads and all.  A very appealing rotating menu of the thumbnails can be used to select which photo(s) you would like to view.GamesI only played PinBall and I hated it.  Having to use the 1 and 3 keys for the flippers with my thumbnails scratching up the bottom of the screen.  Didn't like playing games on it at all.ButtonsLock button is convenient quick slider.  Does have a power button, don't need to hold down the end key.  The volume button is the hardest button I have ever had to press on a phone, don't attempt this one handed.  Memory card slot is hard to open, afraid it will snap off every time I try to open it.  The keypad is backlit in white.  When the keypad idles out, you have the option to have the select button \"pulse\" in a dim bit of light to that it's easy to find in the dark.  Very neat!Video Camera5 megapixel Carl Zeiss lens is the best I've ever seen on a phone.  The shutter button can be held halfway down, just as any other digital camera to focus.  The phone has different scene modes found in other digital cameras, such as Auto, User Defined, Close Up, Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night and Night Portrait.  The camera also has burst mode that works extremely well!  Video tells you how much time you have left (i.e., 1:29:00) but when shooting video, the time rapidly declined to 1:24:00 within 5 seconds and continued declining from there.  The video does have a video light, similar to a flash for still pictures.  White balance, color tone are other options you can use.  The shutter button is hard to press without blurring the shot if you have the flash turned off.  Zoom is slow.  Lots of options for the self timer.  There is a secondary camera used for a self portrait or video calls, but it is definitely a worse lens, etc., as it picks up a lot of noise in low light and the quality is inferior.BrowserA \"pearl\" would definitely come in handing.  Using the Navigation button is tedious and time consuming.  Your thumb starts to hurt after a while of using it to scroll, as well.GeneralBattery will show fully charged for days, but as soon as you take a call, the battery seems to drain super quick, almost like when you have a full tank of gas and the guage doesn't move for days, but as soon as it does, you know you'll be out of gas within 50 miles.  This could be quite confusing for a first time multimedia phone user.  Would recommend to see this in a touch screen with a QWERTY keypad.  The backplate is very delicate and it feels like I'm going to break it.The other day the phone said, \"No SIM Card\" and when I opened the backplate and took the battery out, yep, there was the SIM card.  It had become unsecured.  I'm sure just pressing the battery down would've corrected this, but this could be a pain.  BTW, this happened without me dropping or jarring the phone at all.The kick stand is hard to open the first time, you're afraid you'll break it, however, afterwords it's really easy to open, but not too easy that it'll fly open on its own.If you need to relocate files from one memory source to another, it is a smooth, quick process (i.e., from MicroSD card to 16GB Memory).Quick charging time.The camera lens cover is *not* recessed, making for easy cleaning.FM Radio is excellent, you can use either the handset, headset or stereo speakers.  Also, this has the best stereo sound I have ever heard from a phone, much better than my iPod dock.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Video and Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1234137600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2009"}

I love both, but I prefer the N96 because it has a bigger memory plus the ability to expand.

In preparation for a trip I am loading other movies on additional cards so I can switch them out.  Although watching on such as small screen takes some getting used to, this expansion feature is enough for me to favor this over the N95.  The quality of videos is excellent, but I don't recommend you try to watch films with subtitles :-).The only minus of this v. the N95 is that the N96 has a noticeably shorter battery life (only on standby and voice calls).  I only had to charge my N95 every few days; this one needs it every day or two at the most.The camera is excellent.  In fact, it is the only camera I used on a recent trip and the still pictures and videos are as good as my very expensive (and very heavy) camera.  Having only one thing to carry in my pocket without sacrificing picture quality was wonderful, (and the phone/camera was envied by all who saw it).The phone has lots of useful features even if, like me, you don't subscribe to a data package.  I use the phone to attach to wi-fi when out and check my e-mail, shop at Amazon, etc. This does not use the cell service and so there is no data charge.I still haven't figured out the GPS system, but then again I haven't spent very much time on it.  Not everything on these phones is intuitive and the written instruction book is lacking, but Nokia has an excellent web site with all the information I have needed to answer my questions.This phone is really expensive, but it is worth it.

{"reviewerID": "AX7317G153T8W", "asin": "B001DN5030", "reviewerName": "P. Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "For better or worse, it seems that smartphone reviews nowadays can't escape comparison with the iPhone, especially when that phone heavily touts its value as a consumer entertainment device. As it turns out, I'm an iPhone 3G owner (and former Windows Mobile owner) so this review is no different. I'll go ahead and spoil the ending to say that the N96 is no iPhone killer, but, refreshingly, I found that the N96 outclassed the iPhone's similar features in several areas. In fact, I'd say that while the Nokia N96 isn't for everyone,  it positions itself as a strong media phone for those wanting an alternative to the Apple ecosystem.On paper, the iPhone 3G and Nokia N96 are similar in many ways. Both have up to a 16 GB internal hard drive. Both have GPS. Both are designed to play music, games and widescreen video downloaded from the internet. Both have an \"app store\", where you can purchase and download additional programs. Both have integrated WiFi and both have 3G connectivity (HSDPA).The N96, however, is strong in areas where the iPhone is criticized for being weak. While the iPhone's camera is only 2 MP, the N96 boasts two cameras, one capable of video-calls and the other: an impressive 5 MP camera with a \"flash\" (really more of a close-range light) and lots of settings. The N96 has a removable battery, It has the capability for expanded storage with a Micro SD slot, it can send MMS messages and, most importantly, the phone is unlocked so you're not necessarily stuck with a single cellular provider!The N96 hardware has some great components and features, as well. It comes with an impressive array of accessories that most phones sell separately (for a pretty penny). Included with the phone are an AC adapter, car charger, headphone/aux extension cord with built-in media controls, and even TV-out cables!  The media and games are controlled by physical buttons which makes it easy to feel the buttons and navigate your music in the car without taking your eyes off the road. The built-in FM radio is great for local stations and, in my case, great for tuning into an FM-transmitted TV audio signal while jogging on the treadmill at my gym. The N96 also has the most impressive speakers I've heard on a portable device, producing enough volume to hurt my ears!Unfortunately, there are also several drawbacks to the N96. The N96's 2.8 inch screen, while sufficient, is smaller than the iPhone's. The Nokia app store doesn't have quite the variety and impressiveness of Apple's store. You can transfer purchased movies to the N96 from services like Amazon Unbox, but you can't  play Unbox movie rentals and the movie purchases you CAN transfer are restricted from playing via the included TV-out cables. The operating system can be difficult to use, especially because of the hardware's lack of touch screen, and lastly but most importantly, there's no keyboard, only a numeric keypad, so trying to compose emails and otherwise enter text is downright painful.All in all, however, the N96 is a very powerful entertainment phone. I think most consumers will find the ease of use and elegance of the iPhone more appealing, but I'd recommend this phone to those wanting to watch movies and play games while at the same time preferring to get their media from services like Amazon Unbox rather than the iTunes store. It's also a reasonable buy for those who travel internationally with their smartphone and want to be able to change SIM cards rather than getting ripped off by international roaming or expensive international calling plans.The price is a little steep, though not completely unusual for an high-end unlocked phone of this caliber, and overall I'd give it a weak four star rating: it's great, but far from perfect. The N97, expected in the US shortly after the first half of 2009 looks to have several improvements over the N96, but for those who want a high-end N-series phone sooner rather than later, the N96 will capably meet your needs.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid Media Phone Offering an Alternative to the Apple/iPhone Ecosystem", "unixReviewTime": 1231027200, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2009"}

My former phone was fairly basic, and when I first started enjoying the many features of the N96 I became excited about the myriad of new things I could do--once I learned how.At the heart of the large 16 gig internal storage is the Symbian OS. Awesome. What a welcome relief from Windows Mobile. There is an easy transfer of files from an external memory source. It uses a mini SD card.This gives one flexibility in various types of categorized external files.I immediately noticed how clear the incoming calls were. Sometimes on other units I have had a bit of a problem understanding the audio from an inbound call particular those which have static interference.  The Nokia has very good audio properties, and the sounds are crisp. The speaker phone is a good feature on the N96 because the other party doesn't realize you are using this feature. There is an absence of feed back.Downloading the various features was easy as I took things a step at a time. The internet access works very well. At home it works flawlessly with my wireless router. WLAN can be tricky, and I was very surprised how easy it was to set up on the N96.The most interesting surprise of the N96 is the camera. Wow. The graphics are beautiful. Love the 5MP resolution of the camera, and coupled with the clearness of the 2.8 inch screen the photo viewing is spectacular for a device this small. There are many options in sorting your digital photos. Thumbnails are nice. The TV connection gives an added ability to view your photos on your TV screen. Also I like the fact they included AC and Car chargers.The FM radio expands both music contact and keeping in touch with the local news.

Its included features are enough to make anyone drool.I am using the device with AT&T; Wireless in the United States.  I quickly found that your basic phone functions are more or less easy to use.  Slide down the bottom keypad, and you're ready to dial a number.However, the other features I was so excited to try on the device were somewhat less easy to use.  The small indented power button on top of the device is even a bit confusing.  You have to depress it for a fair amount of time.  This can be a bit of a challenge, with large fingers.The web browser is quite quick, and the silver navigation ring on the front of the phone made it relatively easy to move around webpages.  However, somewhat less easy was figuring out how to connect it to the Internet.  I added my home wifi network, which wasn't too difficult, but I imagine would be a challenge for some users.  However, now, whenever I try to use any Internet based application or service, I have to select what connection I want: my home wifi, the mobile carrier's data network, etc.  It doesn't just connect, you have to confirm and select information every-time you go to do something  Want to listen to Internet radio, get ready to confirm you want to do that and that you want to connect to the Internet, and what connection you want to use. Want to use Nokia Maps?  Get ready to select your Internet connection.  It's really troubling.The phone is also setup by default in metric measurements.  I changed a setting from metric to imperial, but my maps still calculate everything based on kilometers rather than miles.  This does not bother me, for the fact I'm very comfortable with metric measurements, but I imagine others might find this confusing and frustrating. Surely, there is setting to change this, but it is not obvious.Turn by Turn Directions is a bright spot for the Nokia N96.  Nokia will give you a 3 month trial of Turn by Turn Directions.  Then all you need is a connection to the Internet, with your mobile provider, and you can get turn by turn directions from your current location to a destination of your choice.  You can also search for businesses, restaraunts, or anything else you might be interested in driving to.  Walking directions are also available.  I would give the maps and turn by turn implementation on this phone a 4/5.  It works quite nicely, once you get it running, though it is still a bit cumbersome.The camera included with the N96 is another bright spot. For a mobile phone camera, it's one of the best.  It is 5 megapixels, but more importantly it has a good camera lens that take solid pictures under good lighting.  It has an autofocus as well.  Perhaps even more impressive, the video you can shoot with the Nokia N96 is the best quality setting, is also very good.  The video recording capability is one of the things I plan to use the N96 for the most.Connect the N96 to your computer for some exciting options.  On a Windows computer, you can use the Amazon Unbox service, to sync the mobile copies of your purchased TV shows.  This can be good, if you need to watch a show on the go.  It's also easy to use popular music applications (except iTunes obviously) and included software to sync your MP3 files to your phone, such as the ones you can purchase from the Amazon MP3 store.  Videos from Amazon Unbox look quite good when viewed on the N96, and the sound from the Internal speaker and headphones were both impressive.I also tried connecting the N96 to my Mac.  Surprisingly, selecting the mass media option from the handset after connecting it via USB, even my Mac could sync with iPhoto the photos and videos I recorded on the phone!  That is fantastic.  Mac users can still use the N96 to pull the photos and videos they take.  A nice feature.3G - The N96 can connect to AT&T; 3G network where available.  This does allow faster map searching and internet browsing, though drains the battery somewhat quicker.FM Radio - A surprising feature of the Nokia N96 is that when you connect standard headphones, you can listen to your local FM radio.  It may sound like something of the past, but when your device has the capability it is more convenient than you might think.Drawbacks - Again, a big drawback of the N96 is that it is not always easy to use.  You'll spend several minutes, if not longer, the first time you try to do anything.  Furthermore, without a dedicated QWERTY pad, typing messages, emails, or web addresses can be a challenge.Overall, the Nokia N96 brings together a tremendous number of features.  You have a solid phone camera, solid video recorder, multimedia player, music player, FM radio, calendar, web browser, 16 GB of included memory and more.  However, there is a high learning factor, to use many of the features.  Furthermore, with the power and capability of the phone, you sometimes find yourself wishing for a QWERTY keyboard, or a touch screen.The N96 has some amazing capabilities, but for the several hundred dollars the device requires to purchase, I am left wondering how many people should pay that much money, for it.  If you really believe it's the perfect phone for you, I would not discourage you.  However, if you are not completely against getting a contract phone, an offering from Blackberry or the iPhone may be a simpler to use solution.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Feature Packed, Not Easy to Use, but Some Strong Points", "unixReviewTime": 1230940800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2009"}

I currently use a Blackberry Bold 9000, and an iPhone 3g 16gb. Iwill soon be getting a google g1 and a blackberry 8900.I am no stranger to mobile technology and 3g networks....Day One is Today: 1/11/2009I charged the battery overnight and inserted an AT&T; sim card to get itrunning. The N96 walked me through a quick setup wizard for the usual dateand time, etc... We were up and running in less then 5 minutes. GREAT!...nocomplaints there.I went ahead on an exploratory mission. Having used Nokias in the past, thiswas easy for me. I set up my wireless network at home which is usually atabout 80% signal in most of our home. Setup was easy and I was online withthe N96.I started to do the obvious - I kept navigating through the icons to seewhat features were available, what ringtones were included, sample videos,etc. So far so good....I thought the speakers on the phone were a bit out ofshape...but I didnt expect home theater sound either....I setup my POP3 email account, again very easy, and began to test email,messaging, etc.... This is where my woes began. Every few minutes the phonewould ask me if I wanted to use AT&T; medianet to connect since it had lostinternet connection to the wireless network. This kept happening....forabout 30 minutes...until I finally gave up. I went and checked my router etcand there were no internet issues. I rebooted the router, just in case, andstarted to test the phone again about 15 minutes later. Again...it would geton our WIFI and keep dropping it every few minutes...this time I was about25 feet away from my router.Day 1 is over - Day 2 is tomorrow and I will update the reivew then. Pleasedo NOT Vote for me until you have read my entire review for this phone...I am disappointed thus-far.Day 2 01/12/09One note of caution before I begin day 2 of testing. This is a dual sliderphone....from the bottom up you get the keypad for numeric dialing...fromthe top down you get media controls, play/pause etc. I find that the balanceof the phone is thrown off when revealing the keypad and thus dialing is abit difficult on the go....I am a cross platform computer user but prefer to use a mac for most digitalmedia related solutions. Today I will attempt to get the N96 connected tothe mac and do some downloads. I will also be attaching the phone to mywireless network in the office to see if the problems from yesterdayre-appear. (i will update the review as I see fit during the day).I have downloaded the iSync plugin and the Multimedia transfer software from[...] So far so good...easy to install and get going.The N96 seemlesly integrates with the mac in that iPhoto launches showingthe device and images that are on it. It also allows for synchronizing allphotos onto the device....I like this so far. The Nokia Multimedia Transfersuite allows transfer of iTunes music to the device...and now that iTunes isDRM free this will be a nice feature considering the N96's 16gb of memory.The iSync plugin allows you to launch iSync on the mac and add the N96 as adevice...very easy. I can now sync all of my contacts and calendars from mymac to the N96. I dont think too much detail is required on the above twotopics...they are very easy and work well.You must remember to download the software from [...] asit is NOT included on the CD's in the box. The phone can then be connectedvia micro usb and or bluetooth. (Did I mention my gripe due to the fact thatthey chose micro usb instead of mini usb...now we need all new chargers...)My opinion of the phone seems to be improving a bit due to the connectivity,but the wireless lan still remains as a challenge...I have had to turn ofthe WLAN so that I can test and review the phone.Now on to some other features: (brief one liners)FM Radio - Excellent Feature and very clear reception in and around New YorkCity.Camera - Great 5mp Resolution and can be used as a pocket camera whencarrying a 2nd camera is not feasible. However it should be noted that evenin bright daylight the images show some noise..Allows for music and podcasts, which I love. I am a podcast listener due tolong 3-4 hour commutes.(NOTE that the Nokia Software must be running at all times when phone isconnected via usb or bluetooth)Great applications out of the box, not to mention the very refined SymbianOS which allows for great flexibility.Capacity at 16gb is amazing and allows for all of your media to be stored onthe phone.Application/Game downloads from the phone are easy...when the WLAN works.Now for the final portion of my review - Amazon Video on Demand.First things first...you have to use the Amazon Unbox player which is onlyPC compatible for the time being. The VOD service is awesome and the pricesare great. I have seen friends using this in the past but have not tried itmyself until now. The download of unbox was very quick and installation wasperfect. I was able to install the player on Vista 32 Ultimate, login to myamazon account, and download my rented copy of Hancock to watch on my newN96... My first experience with this type of service (other then itunes) hasbeen great. I have always used AMAZON For mp3's but never for Video....I ama blu-ray type and thus enjoy my home theater experience...however I nowhave an alternative to getting movies for viewing while travelling etc....Conclusion:I feel that this phone has a lot more to offer then what I am seeing as aresult of two days of usage. The overall feature set is nice but it isfrustrating to use at best. Considering the $600+ price tag I am sure thatthere are other smart phones out there that can do what the N96 does andmuch more. The iPhone 3g is a perfect example.The 3g service, while in its infancy in the US, is definitely working wellon the N96. The iPhone 3g and Blackberry Bold will drop out on occasionwhere as the N96 is still showing coverage. I think this is because Nokiahas years of experience running on 3g networks and this phone shows it.I apologize for the long review but I felt that an item like this was worthyof a detailed test run...not a quick and dirty review.Pros:CapacityFootprintStyleMedia Syncing AbilitiesCamera (5mp - a bit noisy)Cons:Bad WLAN UsageBad balance while using keypad.Over priced.Controlling the phone is somewhat difficult.Box Includes:Phone.Battery.Chargers for both AC and Car.Headset for use alone or with adapter that has media controls.A/V Cable to attach to TV, etc.USB to Micro USB Cable for Computer hookup.Documentation and software for Windows.Overall I would say this device is worthy of a great review...but I left itat 4 out of 5 because of the unsatisfactory wlan performance. I love thefact that the software Nokia provides makes it very easy to synchronizemedia and contact/calendar data from both a mac and a pc. The price tag is abit on the steep side.It is very hard to review a product with so much power in a short period oftime, thus I am sure I will be updating this review as time goes on. I amhopeful that a firmware upgrade of sorts will fix potential issues on thisdevice and that the future will be bright.Features I still need to test include GPS and Applications.....updates will be forthcoming.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A comprehensive Review - Crossplatform MAC/PC", "unixReviewTime": 1231632000, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2009"}
{"reviewerID": "AU5V90NU1ON6O", "asin": "B001DN5030", "reviewerName": "Tor Slettnes", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewText": "This phone aims to be an upgrade to theN95 8 GB, but it falls a bit short of that.  The feature set is only very minimally upgraded (mainly, more included memory plus a SD slot, a pullout kickstand around the camera lens, and a newer software release), and instead, it introduces some new shortcomings.The first thing that struck me was how much of an underperformer this phone really is.  Using the included music player to stream audio to myPioneer Car Stereoover Bluetooth (A2DP), it would stutter every 11-12 seconds, making for a less-than-stellar playback experience.  I attributed that to its slow processor, though it is possible that a future firmware upgrade would fix this issue.  Either way, i ended up returning it after a few days' use in favor of the slightly newerNokia N85, which in contrast performs much better and feels snappier overall.  (And by the way, looks much more modern and sexy, thanks in part to its gorgeous AMOLED screen).Secondly, a couple of other shortcomings from the original N95 (interational version, N95-1) are reintroduced in the N96.  Both use a 950mAh battery, compared to 1200mAh in the subsequent N95 models as well as the N85, and coupled with its larger 2.8\" LCD screen, it means that it must be charged daily with any extended use.  Also, although it does include 128 MB of RAM (runtime memory), only about 45MB or so are available for applications at startup, so like the N95-1, it is subject to frequent \"out of memory\" errors if you leave a few applications open.Thirdly, although Nokia have resolved their long-standing WCDMA patent dispute with Qualcomm, this phone still only supports North American UMTS bands (850/1900 MHz), whereas the newer N85 has tri-band UMTS (850/1900/2100 MHz) and so will be able to get 3G speeds worldwide.  (Conversely, the international version of the N96 will not get 3G speeds in North America).  In particular, if you plan to travel to Japan or South Korea, this phone will not work at all, wheras the N85 will.  (All these phones support quad-band GSM though, and will work on 2G speeds everywhere else in the world).The distinctive new feature of the N96 is its support for the DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcast for HandHelds) standard; however this feature is not enabled in the U.S. version, since carriers here have chosen to use MediaFLO instead.  The price, however, remains as high as the international version (actually higher for most, since they would get a carrier subsidy in most countries), so you end up paying a premium for a feature you cannot use.On the positive side, this phone has much better support for different video formats/resolutions than other phones (also N-Series ones); it will pretty much play any movie you throw onto it without the need for transcoding or resizing.Also, it built relatively solid (mine did not have any creaking sounds, wobbly slider, or the like), and if you are concerned about build quality, you should definitely choose this over the N85.  Or, you could choose to wait for the recently-announced N86 8MP (which upgrades the N85 with a 8MP camera, 8MB of built-in memory in addition to a SD slot, and more attention to build quality).One note worth mentioning about N-Series and other unlocked phones in general is that although you pay a higher price upfront when compared to other smartphones that are subsidized by the carrier (mainly, AT&T;), you end up earning that back over time -- at least if you include a data plan.  The reason is that AT&T; charges higher prices for their \"smartphone\"/PDA/iPhone etc. plans than for the standard \"data unlimited\" plans.  For instance, the \"data\" portion of the iPhone plan is $30/month, wheras \"data unlimited\" for Symbian S60 phones like the N96/N95/N85 is $10 or $15 per month (depending on whether you also have unlimited messaging).  Over the 2-year contract period for the subsidized phone, that's a $360 or $480 difference - more than enough to offset the initial price difference.  (So basically, compared to the iPhone, you get a lot more capabilities at a lower price).Secondly, \"unlocked\" means that you are free to insert a SIM card from any GSM carrier in the world, not just those from a given carrier.  If you travel abroad, for instance, you can go into a local store to get a prepaid card with local tariffs, whereas with the iPhone you are forced to pay AT&T;'s international roaming charges ($1 - $3 per minute, depending on country).Finally, regarding carrier compatability: This phone is optimized for use on AT&T;'s network, with support for the 850/1900 MHz 3G bands.  It will also work with T-Mobile USA, albeit at 2G (GSM/EDGE) speeds.  It will NOT work with CDMA carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, Alltel, US Cellular, MetroPCS, and so on.  For those carriers, there is no such thing as an \"unlocked\" phone.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not really an upgrade.  Too slow.", "unixReviewTime": 1237420800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2009"}

It's so hard having a Amazon Prime Membership and paying for crappy service when Prime isn't offered.Case:The case is lightweight and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone.  After the first night of use I noticed that the USB cable didn't really fit in the slot.  The USB cable will not fit in secure enough to stay.  After looking at it closer, looks like the space below the USB slot has plenty of space cut out, but the space above the top just barely clears the slot.  So I'm guessing you have to make sure it's in there, or it will just fall out.The power button is a little hard to press with the case on.  I bought this case as a temporary solution until Otterbox comes out with a case (in Blue on July 14th).  Once I get a better case, I will be putting this case in a drawer.Edit: 9-28-13The case has completely fallen apart.  The black ring has come apart from the clear back.

Re the problem I noted below with temperature changes, I noticed that the problem did not occur if I suctioned the unit to the windshield instead of the base, so that's what I had been doing.  Now that it is summer, and the temperature only goes from \"hot\" to \"hotter\" here in Fla, I decided to try the base again, but it keeps falling off.So...I would say the part that holds the phone and suctions to the car is very good.  There are a lot of positions and angles you can adjust to make it comfortable.  The base is not worthwhile.______________2/2/11:  Now that I've had it for a little longer, I want to mention that the suction does not last when there are temperature changes.  For example, if you put it in your car when it is 70 degrees, then park and let it sit while temps drop to 50s, and then you get in the next day, it will tend to fall off, which is a problem.  I notice it more when temps drop than when temps increase, if that makes sense (it was a problem in the winter; not in the summer).Re my problem attaching the product to my dash, what I did was take a section of wire hanger, bend it into an \"S\" shape, and snake one part throught he available loop and the other through a vent that shoots air to my windshield when in \"defrost\" mode.  Holds it perfectly!_______________I bought this because when my new car did not come with a built-in nav system, I decided to use a navigation program that came on my blackberry.  I like that if I ever decide to get a navigation system, I'll be able to use this base for it.This is a very good, though not perfect product.  The contraption that holds the phone is excellent - I really like how maneuverable it is. By attaching the phone holder part \"backwards\" to how it is shown in the picture, I was able to place my phone right along the top of my dash so it doesn't block my windshield.  Doing it this way makes it a little harder to remove the phone holder part from the base, but I haven't had a need or desire to do that.  The suction cup holds very well.  The weight of the base is also good.The negatives relate to securing the product to my dash.  I could not use the mounting hook - the lip of the base is up a bit and it pulls the hook off the dash.  I'm thinking about buying some thick, foam tape and trying to build up the hook a bit.  Without it, the product did not seem secure enough, and actually came loose while I was doing some serious accelleration.  This might be because the bottom of hte base curves a bit, so the middle was not 100% touching the dash (so there is less friction than otherwise).To fix this issue, I took a gel pad that I already had (a 3x5 piece of jelly-like sticky plastic that you can buy almost anywhere - they advertise it for placing on your dash to hold your cell phone flat or keys or glasses) and placed the base on top of that. It seems very secure now and has not budged.  I think the gel pad can be purchased for about $4.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "good product - revised 8/3/11", "unixReviewTime": 1270080000, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2010"}

With three in each pack, I figure I won't have to buy another set until my next phone. :-)The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm, for example). It's not the flimsy, flexible stuff. For example, if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper, then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.The upshot of this is that you don't have to worry about corners folding or bubbles forming during application. You can position it very precisely before applying, and then when you apply, you get a PERFECT result, straight with no bubbles whatsoever (assuming you take a little care, of course, and clean/dry the screen and wipe off any dust or particulate matter before applying).The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice, so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness), you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card. To be honest though, it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway. It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.I see absolutely no evidence of the rainbow, oily pattern that a couple of people have complained about.  I guess it's possible that there was a bad batch, or maybe the problem was solved, but these protectors look great and have no tint, discoloration, or anything of that nature.So you get a high quality, crystal clear, bubble-free, scratch resistant protector that will easily outlast a normal screen protector, and will probably outlast a PACK of normal screen protectors. And you basically get it for the cost of shipping.Remember, I had one on before I bought this most recent set, and it was on the screen from August 2008 until April 2009. It's a no-brainer.

Speaking of bubbles, you just have to be careful.  The protector doesn't make bubbles the person applying the protector allows bubbles if you aren't careful.  I actually think the thickness of these helps you put it on easier without bubbles.  The top sheet that needs to be pulled off once applied is nice so that you can run your scrapper card (You do have one of those, right.  If not, no wonder you are getting bubbles.

I was on a budget and found online an unlocked HP Ipaq model 6900. I read the reviews and some were good and some were bad, needless to say I took a chance and bought this thing. The phone was actually a refurbished phone not by the manufacturer, but by a third party vendor, and I had no way of knowing this since the description was misleading (no, it was not Amazon) I started to use the phone only to realize my worst nightmare, the phone did everything well except make calls when I neede to. I also learned that the battery gauge was always reading wrong from one of the HP forums, and when I thought I had a full charge it was actually half charged and the phone could not work.I have since then learned to live with the mistake I made and use this phone as a really bulky PDA or pocket game playing gadget while in the john. I also found out that Windows mobile 5.0 was not the most robust operating system for a phone, much less this one and provisions to update were not allowed.As time went by I learned that Microsoft had updated their mobile operating system and newer and better phones were hitting the market. I was a bit hesitant to go with any of the newer HP products since they were really expensive and I had such a horible experience with the first phone. I did some research on what windows based phone would be ideal for my situation and when I learned about the Palm Treo Pro I decided to look into it. I wanted to see what it looked like but T mobile nor at&t; had this phone, Sprint did, so I went to one of their stores to check it out and the features as well. I really loved the phone, but I was not able to cancel my plan to go to Sprint, so unlocked was the way to go for me.I received the phone and had read some reviews that T mobile did not work very well with the phone, and that everyone was touting the mighty Iphone. The Iphone has some nice software and it is the rave, but when I installed my sim card into this phone, it was ready to go in just under a minute, it came on read the network ID and autoconfigured itself and worked well. I found out from a friend that the newer phones were having their sim cards replaced with more capacity and better handleing of the data. I went to T mobile and they said that there were some cases of this and agreed to swap out the sim for a new one. At that moment was when the phone woke up and started with crystal clear calls, all data was updated flawlessly from my Outlook account from work, the web pages loaded better and this phone has since been everthing that the Ipaq was not.Like others, my only complaint is on the QWERTY keypad being too small, other than that, hats off to Palm for finally releasing a phone that actually does what its supposed to do, and all the software works without incident, many features like the out of the box self configuration was really helpful, wifi works anyplace there is an open hotspot, the micro SD chip can be installed up to 32GB capacity, it is not a battery hog either; I usually get two full days on a charge when using phone, data, mail push and even GPS.Great phone, if you have a GSM service get it unlocked, if you have no service you may want to try Sprint, and even if you dont sign up with them you can see the phone in action.

It has the typical WM6.1 Professional OS and accompanying programs, but there are little settings here and there that make it a little or a lot more handy for some of us veteran WM users who have been observing the slow crawl of advancement that Microsoft has made in updated OS's. And some if not a lot of this may be thanks to the manufacturer (Palm, c/o HTC), but let me give a couple examples.Normally, you have to tap and hold for the context menu of a highlighted item. And if you have an extra program, such as Spb Pocket Plus, you may be able to set a hardware button to do this for you, something handy I've done in the past. But the Treo Pro allows you to press and hold the Palm button (the center select button of the 5-way navigation button), and the context menu comes up. And, even though I relied upon Spb for the Close button, it's nice to see this device (and other HTC devices now) have the Close button option embedded. Another example is you can optionally respond to Ignored calls with an automated text message, something that Spb Phone Suite has if you buy it and install it, but the device comes with this feature preloaded. And there are a few others.Yes, there are a few drawbacks, such as the glossy appearance easily getting fingerprints, and the odd fact that there is no real device-off status apart from removing the battery. The Power button turns the screen off with one press, and turns the phone on or off of flight mode when pressing and holding. To access the Reset button, you have to remove the stylus, and it is accessible right where the head of the stylus rests, WITHOUT having to remove the back battery panel (unlike some have said is necessary to access it).As for the screen, some say it is a little washed out, like too whitish. But two things...first, this has decent battery life even if you turn the screen to full brightness (I have push email and two other email accounts checking email all day, along with text, light Internet browsing, and some phone calling), which makes me have to charge it every night, but I'm used to that. So full brightness is a good option. But MOREOVER, the screen is of a technology such that in the glaring sunlight, it has a special effect where you can read everything still! That is a major plus that I will take any day. And speaking of the screen, some don't like it being flush with the rest of the device, but I like that it is that newer type of screen that is more resilient and scratch resistant, and it is just as touch sensitive as the previous types of touch screens.As far as batteries go, I have an extended life battery (there are 2 types out there I know of), and I can go 2 days on a single charge. (The battery I got has the same gloss and matching appearance, but there's another with a non-gloss battery door...I just wanted my door to match the rest of the phone). Yes, extended batteries make the phone more bulky, so get it if you don't mind that. I personally like the phone a little bigger. It makes it feel more firm and solid to me.Every once in a while, a few of the main function buttons will not work on a Bluetooth phone call, but this has only happened twice to me. Again, I know most handheld devices are a little quirky, so I'll take this any day to the other quirky WM devices I've had with features not quite as good as this one.Hope this review helps...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Palm's (and one of Windows Mobile's) best yet...", "unixReviewTime": 1246060800, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2009"}

Sometimes they break and other times they don't work well.

Or, I can carry it in a pocket, especially if I am wearing a sports coat or jacket.  I don't like to carry a headset without a case in my pocket because it can easily get damaged or it can be inadvertently switched on.  I am also not one of those people that keep a Bluetooth headset in my ear all the time.  It is inconsiderate to talk to folks face to face while you have a headset in your ear.  I just use it when I need it.In my car, I put the headset in the case and put the case in the trunk or in the center console. If you are like me, I have other items in the console or in the trunk which can scratch or harm the headset if I did not use a case.The case is small and protects a headset very well.

Breakfield IV \"Tom Steele\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I've used several brands of screen protector and they are all hard to line up and get on your iphone without dust getting underneath.  These are no exception.However, once you get one lined up and on the phone, these work very well and last quite a while (3 months +) before needing replacement.I am adding my most recent experience to help others who are having trouble getting these screen protectors on their phones.  This worked very well for me in my most recent application.If you get lint on the side of your protector that sticks to the phone, guess what works splendidly for removing the lint - masking tape.  Use it like a lint roller.  Just tap the masking tape anywhere you see lint and lift it off.  The tape does not stick to the protector and takes the lint off.Obviously you are going to carefully clean the screen in as dust-free environment as possible.  I used the kitchen island.  It also helps to have a light above you so you can see a reflection from the screen and look carefully for lint. Wear reading glasses if you need to, they will give you a good view of any lint on the screen.I find the usual recommendation of starting at the button and working upward to be a recipe for misalignment disaster.  I find it much better to carefully center the hole at the bottom of the screen protector over the button at the bottom of the phone first and without putting the screen protector down, align the ear-piece opening with the slit at the top of the phone and then lay the screen protector down with a line running vertically down the center of the screen and let it fan out in each direction.I still ended up with a couple of lint pieces under the screen.  They tend to stick to the protector, not the screen so I lifted the protector up by the edge with a small knife and slid (you guessed it) the masking tape under the screen protector (face up so the adhesive is facing the protector NOT the screen, which it will stick firmly to and you don't want that!) and then pressed the protector down on the tape, then lifted and removed the tape and pressed the protector back down.  I did this for all the lint and it works.  I had a PERFECT screen protector application.Using this method I was able to put protectors on my phone and my wife's phone with no trepidation, no frustration (which happens when you think you are throwing away a couple of dollars each failed try!) and no lint or bubbles!I hope this helps others who are having trouble applying these protectors!Finally, the pricing here seems to vary wildly from week to week, but generally the after shipping price of ~$5 for three is much better than the $9.99 my local stores charge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "All screen protectors are hard to apply - these work though.", "unixReviewTime": 1247961600, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2009"}

This works about as well as most FM modulators (like the ones available for MP3 players).  It is pretty reliable once you find that perfect frequency, but as soon as you drive outside of your city, you must find a frequency that works well at your destination. I use the FM feature only when I'm in my home city and then use the built in speaker for traveling outside my city. If you don't find a nice quiet empty spot on your FM dial, static is really bad and audio will cut out occasionally, forcing you to use the built in speaker.  I was very pleased to discover that the iPhone 3GS will not only broadcast calls to the device via bluetooth, it sends all system audio to your Jabra, including music, podcasts, and message alerts.  I keep my iPhone on a charger and stow it in the console, and can listen to music from it over my radio, and take calls as they come in.Voice dialing works really well, even better than when using the wired headset that was included with my iPhone 3GS.Battery life is very good.  I've been using it for two weeks without charging it and it performs as well as it did with a full charge (in two weeks I've made or taken probably 30 short calls with it and sent hours of music to my radio from the iphone with it).

But the battery only requires recharging once every three or four weeks. It's just as easy to slip the Jabra into my pocket and bring it inside to charge off the computer's USB port, when the time comes. The unit gives a verbal warning when the battery is low, and unfortunately, the notice is short, so there's not much use left after the first warning comes and the \"depleted battery\" LED illuminates.Pairing couldn't be simpler. And frankly, once it's paired, it doesn't need to be touched again. I've used my with Blackberry 9530 Storm and 9550 Storm 2, without a hiccup. Voice dialing commands are easily recognized by the Jabra, and if there's every a problem (occasionally it gets stuck in the voice dial menu), it appears to be the phone's fault, not the speakerphone's.Voice quality is excellent. I never get complaints that my voice is inaudible or unclear, and the volume pumping out of the Jabra's speaker is loud and good quality. By comparison, I use a hard-wired Parrot system with a separate mic, speaker and control module at work, and while the Parrot's vehicle-powered speaker is louder, I don't find that complex system as a whole any more usable than the SP700.If there's one complaint, it's that this speakerphone appears as an \"Audio Sink\" device (shouldn't that be \"audio sync\"??) and sometimes my BlackBerry chooses to pair with it instead of myBlackBerry Bluetooth Stereo Gatewaydevice, which interfaces with my car's stereo. To prevent this, I have to make sure to start my car prior to powering on the Jabra, allowing the Stereo Gateway to power up and pair with the phone first. Doing so makes everything work correctly for the rest of my car time, even in instances where I'm running errands, in and out of the car, where the Stereo Gateway constantly is switched on and off yet the Jabra remains powered on.And the BlackBerry has no problem referring all phone calls to the Jabra while directing Pandora music to the Stereo Gateway.While I'd prefer to have a built-in speaker phone with no charging or sun visor usage issues, the reality is I've installed a \"built in\" speakerphone in my wife's car, and a mic problem resulted in a problem that took a whole lot of interior disassembly work to correct.

Thankfully, there is a new option for cell phone owners with the Deluxe Smart Clip. This cell phone clip is easy to setup by just peeling the back of the adhesive and pressing it on the cell phone. It holds very strongly and feels very secure whenever you're on the go. It holds easily and sets up nicely as you hook it to one of the loops of your pants. It works nicely for light cell phones, but for those bigger ones like Apple's Iphone, it does feel a lot bulkier, and can easily fall off. It also doesn't work as well with holding MP3 players too. But overall, if you want a simple way to carry your cell phone, the Deluxe Smart Clip does overall do a strong job.Price: BConvience: C+Overall: B-", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Phone Aid", "unixReviewTime": 1236643200, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2009"}

One thing I did notice was that if you don't use the screen protector that comes with the case. there is a good chance that the case itself will push up against the bottom of your protector.

Just today I found out that there was another crack on the circle part of the case on the back that holds the 2 pieces together. I just found it ridiculous that this case got such good reviews initially, so I decided to write this to help even things out.

Lots of little scratches on the case, but that is to be expected.  When I remove the case (and brush off the dust that gets in through the cracks), the back and sides of my iPhone 3G look perfectly brand spanking new, like I bought it yesterday.  It does cause little air bubbles in the corners of the screen protector but, once again, that is to be expected with any case that hugs the sides of the phone.In short, this was definitely worth the $20 I paid for it (incl. S&H;). I can't compare it to other cases, except that it looks nicer than a lot of other cases I've seen.  If, after some time, the case breaks, I will buy this exact same case again.May 13, 2010 Update:In just under a year (a couple of months ago), the thin strip of plastic at the bottom front broke off.  Although I hoped the product would last a year intact, I am still pleased with how long it lasted, given the price and considering how small a piece is now unprotected.Lots of scratches on the case now and the downside is that friends think I've been treating my phone roughly, but I think the case just scratches easily.  Out of this case my phone still looks brand-newish over a year later.Although 90% of the case is intact, today I ordered a new iFrogz Luxe Case in a different color so that I will have that strip of plastic protecting the bottom front of the phone.Update:Noticed a small crack in the phone as I was swapping cases.
